1. Meeting Opening

The serenity prayer was said  
The previous minutes were read and ratified  
From the previous meeting minutes business, matters on facilities, financial matters and meeting advertising came up.  


2. Rent business

It was asked about the current nature of the rental agreement with regards to the current rental rate  
The previous rate was 125 EURO per month between the three groups, each with 4 meetings per month, making 12 meetings for 125 EURO.  
A request was made to the parish secretary to remove from their  their meeting schedule which are now closed.  She said she would do that and reach out after discussion with the administration team with regards to a new rental agreement.  
It was also said to her that other meeting slots may be restarted at a later date, such as the Summer.  


3. AA Ireland meeting finder issues

Matters relating to the rent business included the AA website's advertising of the closed meetings.  
The concern was raised that GSO has not processed the requests made of the group conscience of the Bundoran group's.  
GIS forms have been submitted on numerous occasions and requests have been made via email.  
GSO said they would process such requests the following Monday but has on numerous occasions now not followed up with that.  
The intergroup secretary was also contacted in regards to this and did look into it, but seemed to express a misunderstanding of the nature of the GIS submissions made.  
Concern is expressed because members are travelling to attend the meetings advertised which are no longer open.  
It was agreed that this is an important issue and to bring this concern to Donegal Area.  


4. Conscience structure and service members

It was asked about increasing attendance at the group conscience meetings and how this relates to important business over the recent changing times of the group.  
The consensus expressed is to keep things simple and to be mindful of balancing how encouraging members to attend and do service can sometimes inadvertently be a pressure counter to personal recovery.  
Particularly considering any recent controversies and how that can relate to personal recovery.  
It was noted that our priority is to grow a positive inclusive atmosphere for other members to become more involved.  


5. Financial matters

Treasury matters were raised that the books have been neglected somewhat over the year including recurring issues with storage of money until it could be consolidated into the bank by the treasurer.  
A motion was suggested by C to  
The role of treasurer is still vacant.  
It was noted how it's generally suggested to leave a role vacant until someone becomes willing and available for the role.  


6. Area business

It was agreed that our group conscience will put forward to Donegal Area a motion to create a 'Young Person's Liason Officer' role. It would be the area equivalent of the YPLO role currently at the level of intergroup and conference, and will be similar in structure to the PI roles.  
It was also agreed that our group would put forward a conference motion to integrate the AA Ireland meeting finder with AAWS meeting finder. This is amongst a set of reasons to allow better technological navigation and to allow foreign visitors of other nations who use such an app to more naturally find meetings during their time in Ireland.  
Furthermore, it was agreed as per the meeting reports, to carry forward business matters relating to an apparent breakdown in GSO service in regards to GIS forms and the meeting finder.
