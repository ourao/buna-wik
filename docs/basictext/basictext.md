# The Basic Text

## 2nd Preface

THIS IS the second edition of the book \"Alcoholics Anonymous,\" which
made its first appearance in April 1939. More than 300,000 copies of the
first edition are now in circulation. Because this book has become the
basic text for our Society and has helped such large numbers of
alcoholic men and women to recovery, there exists a sentiment against
any radical changes being made in it. Therefore, the first portion of
this volume, describing the A.A. recovery program, has been left largely
untouched.

But the personal history section has been considerably revised and
enlarged in order to present a more accurate representation of our
membership as it is today. When the book was first printed, we had
scarcely 100 members all told, and every one of them was an almost
hopeless case of alcoholism. This has changed. A.A. now helps alcoholics
in all stages of the disease. It reaches into every level of life and
into nearly all occupations. Our membership now includes many young
people. Women, who were at first very reluctant to approach A.A., have
come forward in large numbers. Therefore the range of the story section
has been broadened so that every alcoholic reader may find a reflection
of him or herself in it.

As a souvenir of our past, the original Foreword has been preserved and
is followed by a second on describing Alcoholics Anonymous of 1955.

Following the Forewords, there appears a section called \"The Doctor's
Opinion.\" This also has been kept intact, just as it was originally
written in 1939 by the late Dr. William D. Silkworth, our Society's
great medical benefactor. Besides Dr. Silkworth's original statement,
there have been added, in the Appendices, a number of the medical and
religious endorsements which have come to us in recent years.

On the last pages of this second edition will be found the Twelve
Traditions of Alcoholics Anonymous, the principles upon which our A.A.
groups function, together with the directions for getting in touch with
A.A.

## 1st Foreword

*This is the Foreword as it appeared in the first printing of the first
edition in 1939.*

WE, OF Alcoholics Anonymous, are more than one hundred men and women who
have recovered from a seemingly hopeless state of mind and body. To show
other alcoholics precisely how we have recovered is the main purpose of
this book. For them, we hope these pages will prove so convincing that
no further authentication will be necessary. We think this account of
our experiences will help everyone to better understand the alcoholic.
Many do not comprehend that the alcoholic is a very sick person. And
besides, we are sure that our way of living has its advantages for all.

It is important that we remain anonymous because we are too few, at
present to handle the overwhelming number of personal appeals which may
result from this publication. Being mostly business or professional
folk, we could not well carry on our occupations in such an event. We
would like it understood that our alcoholic work is an avocation.

When writing or speaking publicly about alcoholism, we urge each of our
Fellowship to omit his personal name, designating himself instead as "a
member of Alcoholics Anonymous."

Very earnestly we ask the press also, to observe this request, for
otherwise we shall be greatly handicapped.

We are not an organization in the conventional sense of the word. There
are no fees or dues whatsoever. The only requirement for membership is
an honest desire to stop drinking. We are not allied with any particular
faith, sect or denomination, nor do we oppose anyone. We simply wish to
be helpful to those who are afflicted.

We shall be interested to hear from those who are getting results from
this book, particularly from those who have commenced work with other
alcoholics. We should like to be helpful to such cases.

Inquiry by scientific, medical, and religious societies will be
welcomed.

ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS

## 2nd Foreword

The fellowship grows large and beyond the U.S borders. Bill's sobriety
is mentioned in conjuction with Silkworth, followed by Bill's meeting of
Bob. Bill persuades Bob for the necessity of a new type of spiritual
thirst. That vigor leads forth into the beginning of the first group as
well as the fellowship as a whole.

The Bigbook recieves public acclaim and the AAWS begins serving the
growing needs of those who suffer. AA starts recieving growing public
attention and membership grows further. This brings problems of
leadership from which comes the traditions and concepts. These ere
ratified by the first conference.

Public acceptance grows through overwhelming success stories and the
advocations of those closest to the early success stories. AA begins
formulating opinions on controversial topics such as its official stance
of neutrality on subjects such as religion, and of its medical point of
view. The fellowship now has a bright hope for the future through its
maturing ethos.

Figures given in this foreword describe the Fellowship as it was in
1955.

Since the original Foreword to this book was written in 1939, a
wholesale miracle has taken place. Our earliest printing voiced the hope
"that every alcoholic who journeys will find the Fellowship of
Alcoholics Anonymous at his destination. Already," continues the early
text "twos and threes and fives of us have sprung up in other
communities."

Sixteen years have elapsed between our first printing of this book and
the presentation in 1955 of our second edition. In that brief space,
Alcoholics Anonymous has mushroomed into nearly 6,000 groups whose
membership is far above 150,000 recovered alcoholics. Groups are to be
found in each of the United States and all of the provinces of Canada.
A.A. has flourishing communities in the British Isles, the Scandinavian
countries, South Africa, South America, Mexico, Alaska, Australia and
Hawaii. All told, promising beginnings have been made in some 50 foreign
countries and U. S. possessions. Some are just now taking shape in Asia.
Many of our friends encourage us by saying that this is but a beginning,
only the augury of a much larger future ahead.

The spark that was to flare into the first A.A. group was struck at
Akron, Ohio, in June 1935, during a talk between a New York stockbroker
and an Akron physician. Six months earlier, the broker had been relieved
of his drink obsession by a sudden spiritual experience, following a
meeting with an alcoholic friend who had been in contact with the Oxford
Groups of that day. He had also been greatly helped by the late Dr.
William D. Silkworth, a New York specialist in alcoholism who is now
accounted no less than a medical saint by A.A. members, and whose story
of the early days of our Society appears in the next pages. From this
doctor, the broker had learned the grave nature of alcoholism. Though he
could not accept all the tenets of the Oxford Groups, he was convinced
of the need for moral inventory, confession of personality defects,
restitution to those harmed, helpfulness to others, and the necessity of
belief in and dependence upon God.

Prior to his journey to Akron, the broker had worked hard with many
alcoholics on the theory that only an alcoholic could help an alcoholic,
but he had succeeded only in keeping sober himself. The broker had gone
to Akron on a business venture which had collapsed, leaving him greatly
in fear that he might start drinking again. He suddenly realized that in
order to save himself he must carry his message to another alcoholic.
That alcoholic turned out to be the Akron physician.

This physician had repeatedly tried spiritual means to resolve his
alcoholic dilemma but had failed. But when the broker gave him Dr.
Silkworth's description of alcoholism and its hopelessness, the
physician began to pursue the spiritual remedy for his malady with a
willingness he had never before been able to muster. He sobered, never
to drink again up to the moment of his death in 1950. This seemed to
prove that one alcoholic could affect another as no nonalcoholic could.
It also indicated that strenuous work, one alcoholic with another, was
vital to permanent recovery.

Hence the two men set to work almost frantically upon alcoholics
arriving in the ward of the Akron City Hospital. Their very first case,
a desperate one, recovered immediately and became A.A. number three. He
never had another drink. This work at Akron continued through the summer
of 1935. There were many failures, but there was an occasional
heartening success. When the broker returned to New York in the fall of
1935, the first A.A. group had actually been formed, though no one
realized it at the time.

A second small group promptly took shape at New York, to be followed in
1937 with the start of a third at Cleveland. Besides these, there were
scattered alcoholics who had picked up the basic ideas in Akron or New
York who were trying to form groups in other cities. By late 1937, the
number of members having substantial sobriety time behind them was
sufficient to convince the membership that a new light had entered the
dark world of the alcoholic.

It was now time, the struggling groups thought, to place their message
and unique experience before the world. This determination bore fruit in
the spring of 1939 by the publication of this volume. The membership had
then reached about 100 men and women. The fledgling society, which had
been nameless, now began to be called Alcoholics Anonymous, from the
title of its own book. The flying-blind period ended and A.A. entered a
new phase of its pioneering time.

With the appearance of the new book a great deal began to happen. Dr.
Harry Emerson Fosdick, the noted clergyman, reviewed it with approval.
In the fall of 1939 Fulton Oursler, then editor of Liberty, printed a
piece in his magazine, called "Alcoholics and God." This brought a rush
of 800 frantic inquiries into the little New York office which meanwhile
had been established. Each inquiry was painstakingly answered; pamphlets
and books were sent out. Businessmen, traveling out of existing groups,
were referred to these prospective newcomers. New groups started up and
it was found, to the astonishment of everyone, that A.A.'s message could
be transmitted in the mail as well as by word of mouth. By the end of
1939 it was estimated that 800 alcoholics were on their way to recovery.

In the spring of 1940, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. gave a dinner for many
of his friends to which he invited A.A. members to tell their stories.
News of this got on the world wires; inquiries poured in again and many
people went to the bookstores to get the book "Alcoholics Anonymous.''
By March 1941 the membership had shot up to 2,000. Then Jack Alexander
wrote a feature article in the Saturday Evening Post and placed such a
compelling picture of A.A. before the general public that alcoholics in
need of help really deluged us. By the close of 1941, A.A. numbered
8,000 members. The mushrooming process was in full swing. A.A. had
become a national institution.

Our Society then entered a fearsome and exciting adolescent period. The
test that it faced was this: Could these large numbers of erstwhile
erratic alcoholics successfully meet and work together? Would there be
quarrels over membership, leadership, and money? Would there be
strivings for power and prestige? Would there be schisms which would
split A.A. apart? Soon A.A. was beset by these very problems on every
side and in every group. But out of this frightening and at first
disrupting experience the conviction grew that A.A.'s had to hang
together or die separately. We had to unify our Fellowship or pass off
the scene.

As we discovered the principles by which the individual alcoholic could
live, so we had to evolve principles by which the A.A. groups and A.A.
as a whole could survive and function effectively. It was thought that
no alcoholic man or woman could be excluded from our Society; that our
leaders might serve but never govern; that each group was to be
autonomous and there was to be no professional class of therapy. There
were to be no fees or dues; our expenses were to be met by our own
voluntary contributions. There was to be the least possible
organization, even in our service centers. Our public relations were to
be based upon attraction rather than promotion. It was decided that all
members ought to be anonymous at the level of press, radio, TV and
films. And in no circumstances should we give endorsements, make
alliances, or enter public controversies.

This was the substance of A.A.'s Twelve Traditions, which are stated in
full on page 561 of this book. Though none of these principles had the
force of rules or laws, they had become so widely accepted by 1950 that
they were confirmed by our first International Conference held at
Cleveland. Today the remarkable unity of A.A. is one of the greatest
assets that our Society has.

While the internal difficulties of our adolescent period were being
ironed out, public acceptance of A.A. grew by leaps and bounds. For this
there were two principal reasons: the large numbers of recoveries, and
reunited homes. These made their impressions everywhere. Of alcoholics
who came to A.A. and really tried, 50% got sober at once and remained
that way; 25% sobered up after some relapses, and among the remainder,
those who stayed on with A.A. showed improvement. Other thousands came
to a few A.A. meetings and at first decided they didn't want the
program. But great numbers of these---about two out of three---began to
return as time passed.

Another reason for the wide acceptance of A.A. was the ministration of
friends - friends in medicine, religion, and the press, together with
innumerable others who became our able and persistent advocates. Without
such support, A.A. could have made only the slowest progress. Some of
the recommendations of A.A.'s early medical and religious friends will
be found further on in this book.

Alcoholics Anonymous is not a religious organization. Neither does A.A.
take any particular medical point of view, though we cooperate widely
with the men of medicine as well as with the men of religion. Alcohol
being no respecter of persons, we are an accurate cross section of
America, and in distant lands, the same democratic evening-up process is
now going on. By personal religious affiliation, we include Catholics,
Protestants, Jews, Hindus, and a sprinkling of Moslems and Buddhists.
More than 15% of us are women.

At present, our membership is pyramiding at the rate of about twenty per
cent a year. So far, upon the total problem of several million actual
and potential alcoholics in the world, we have made only a scratch. In
all probability, we shall never be able to touch more than a fair
fraction of the alcohol problem in all its ramifications. Upon therapy
for the alcoholic himself, we surely have no monopoly. Yet it is our
great hope that all those who have as yet found no answer may begin to
find one in the pages of this book and will presently join us on the
high road to a new freedom.

## The Doctor's Opinion

WE OF Alcoholics Anonymous believe that the reader will be interested in
the medical estimate of the plan of recovery described in this book.
Convincing testimony must surely come from medical men who have had
experience with the sufferings of our members and have witnessed our
return to health. A well known doctor, chief physician at a nationally
prominent hospital specializing in alcoholic and drug addiction, gave
Alcoholics Anonymous this letter:

To Whom It May Concern:

I have specialized in the treatment of alcoholism for many years.

In late 1934 I attended a patient who, though he had been a competent
business man of good earning capacity, was an alcoholic of a type I had
come to regard as hopeless.

In the course of his third treatment he acquired certain ideas
concerning a possible means of recovery. As part of his rehabilitation
he commenced to present his conceptions to other alcoholics, impressing
upon them that they must do likewise with still others. This has become
the basis of a rapidly growing fellowship of these men and their
families. This man and over one hundred others appear to have recovered.

I personally know scores of cases who were of the type with whom other
methods had failed completely.

These facts appear to be of extreme medical importance; because of the
extraordinary possibilities of rapid growth inherent in this group they
may mark a new epoch in the annals of alcoholism. These men may well
have a remedy for thousands of such situations.

You may rely absolutely on anything they say about themselves.

Very truly yours,

William D. Silkworth, M.D.

The physician who, at our request, gave us this letter, has been kind
enough to enlarge upon his views in another statement which follows. In
this statement he confirms what we who have suffered alcoholic torture
must believe-that the body of the alcoholic is quite as abnormal as his
mind. It did not satisfy us to be told that we could not control our
drinking just because we were maladjusted to life, that we were in full
flight from reality, or were outright mental defectives. These things
were true to some extent, in fact, to a considerable extent with some of
us. But we are sure that our bodies were sickened as well. In our
belief, any picture of the alcoholic which leaves out this physical
factor is incomplete.

The doctor's theory that we have an allergy to alcohol interests us. As
laymen, our opinion as to its soundness may, of course, mean little. But
as ex-problem drinkers, we can say that his explanation makes good
sense. It explains many things for which we cannot otherwise account.

Though we work out our solution on the spiritual as well as an
altruistic plane, we favor hospitalization for the alcoholic who is very
jittery or befogged. More often than not, it is imperative that a man's
brain be cleared before he is approached, as he has then a better chance
of understanding and accepting what we have to offer.

The doctor writes:

The subject presented in this book seems to me to be of paramount
importance to those afflicted with alcoholic addiction.

I say this after many years' experience as Medical Director of one of
the oldest hospitals in the country treating alcoholic and drug
addiction.

There was, therefore, a sense of real satisfaction when I was asked to
contribute a few words on a subject which is covered in such masterly
detail in these pages.

We doctors have realized for a long time that some form of moral
psychology was of urgent importance to alcoholics, but its application
presented difficulties beyond our conception. What with our ultra-modern
standards, our scientific approach to everything, we are perhaps not
well equipped to apply the powers of good that lie outside our synthetic
knowledge.

Many years ago one of the leading contributors to this book came under
our care in this hospital and while here he acquired some ideas which he
put into practical application at once.

Later, he requested the privilege of being allowed to tell his story to
other patients here and with some misgiving, we consented. The cases we
have followed through have been most interesting; in fact, many of them
are amazing. The unselfishness of these men as we have come to know
them, the entire absence of profit motive, and their community spirit,
is indeed inspiring to one who has labored long and wearily in this
alcoholic field. They believe in themselves, and still more in the Power
which pulls chronic alcoholics back from the gates of death.

Of course an alcoholic ought to be freed from his physical craving for
liquor, and this often requires a definite hospital procedure, before
psychological measures can be of maximum benefit.

We believe, and so suggested a few years ago, that the action of alcohol
on these chronic alcoholics is a manifestation of an allergy; that the
phenomenon of craving is limited to this class and never occurs in the
average temperate drinker. These allergic types can never safely use
alcohol in any form at all; and once having formed the habit and found
they cannot break it, once having lost their self-confidence, their
reliance upon things human, their problems pile up on them and become
astonishingly difficult to solve.

Frothy emotional appeal seldom suffices. The message which can interest
and hold these alcoholic people must have depth and weight. In nearly
all cases, their ideals must be grounded in a power greater than
themselves, if they are to re-create their lives.

If any feel that as psychiatrists directing a hospital for alcoholics we
appear somewhat sentimental, let them stand with us a while on the
firing line, see the tragedies, the despairing wives, the little
children; let the solving of these problems become a part of their daily
work, and even of their sleeping moments, and the most cynical will not
wonder that we have accepted and encouraged this movement. We feel,
after many years of experience, that we have found nothing which has
contributed more to the rehabilitation of these men than the altruistic
movement now growing up among them.

Men and women drink essentially because they like the effect produced by
alcohol. The sensation is so elusive that, while they admit it is
injurious, they cannot after a time differentiate the true from the
false. To them, their alcoholic life seems the only normal one. They are
restless, irritable and discontented, unless they can again experience
the sense of ease and comfort which comes at once by taking a few
drinks-drinks which they see others taking with impunity. After they
have succumbed to the desire again, as so many do, and the phenomenon of
craving develops, they pass through the well-known stages of a spree,
emerging remorseful, with a firm resolution not to drink again. This is
repeated over and over, and unless this person can experience an entire
psychic change there is very little hope of his recovery.

On the other hand-and strange as this may seem to those who do not
understand- once a psychic change has occurred, the very same person who
seemed doomed, who had so many problems he despaired of ever solving
them, suddenly finds himself easily able to control his desire for
alcohol, the only effort necessary being that required to follow a few
simple rules.

Men have cried out to me in sincere and despairing appeal: \"Doctor, I
cannot go on like this! I have everything to live for! I must stop, but
I cannot! You must help me!\"

Faced with this problem, if a doctor is honest with himself, he must
sometimes feel his own inadequacy. Although he gives all that is in him,
it often is not enough. One feels that something more than human power
is needed to produce the essential psychic change. Though the aggregate
of recoveries resulting from psychiatric effort is considerable, we
physicians must admit we have made little impression upon the problem as
a whole. Many types do not respond to the ordinary psychological
approach.

I do not hold with those who believe that alcoholism is entirely a
problem of mental control. I have had many men who had, for example,
worked a period of months on some problem or business deal which was to
be settled on a certain date, favorably to them. They took a drink a day
or so prior to the date, and then the phenomenon of craving at once
became paramount to all other interests so that the important
appointment was not met. These men were not drinking to escape; they
were drinking to overcome a craving beyond their mental control.

There are many situations which arise out of the phenomenon of craving
which cause men to make the supreme sacrifice rather than continue to
fight.

The classification of alcoholics seems most difficult, and in much
detail is outside the scope of this book. There are, of course, the
psychopaths who are emotionally unstable. We are all familiar with this
type. They are always \"going on the wagon for keeps.\" They are
over-remorseful and make many resolutions, but never a decision.

There is the type of man who is unwilling to admit that he cannot take a
drink. He plans various ways of drinking. He changes his brand or his
environment. There is the type who always believes that after being
entirely free from alcohol for a period of time he can take a drink
without danger. There is the manic-depressive type, who is, perhaps, the
least understood by his friends, and about whom a whole chapter could be
written.

Then there are types entirely normal in every respect except in the
effect alcohol has upon them. They are often able, intelligent, friendly
people.

All these, and many others, have one symptom in common: they cannot
start drinking without developing the phenomenon of craving. This
phenomenon, as we have suggested, may be the manifestation of an allergy
which differentiates these people, and sets them apart as a distinct
entity. It has never been, by any treatment with which we are familiar,
permanently eradicated. The only relief we have to suggest is entire
abstinence.

This immediately precipitates us into a seething caldron of debate. Much
has been written pro and con, but among physicians, the general opinion
seems to be that most chronic alcoholics are doomed.

What is the solution? Perhaps I can best answer this by relating one of
my experiences.

About one year prior to this experience a man was brought in to be
treated for chronic alcoholism. He had but partially recovered from a
gastric hemorrhage and seemed to be a case of pathological mental
deterioration. He had lost everything worth while in life and was only
living, one might say, to drink. He frankly admitted and believed that
for him there was no hope. Following the elimination of alcohol, there
was found to be no permanent brain injury. He accepted the plan outlined
in this book. One year later he called to see me, and I experienced a
very strange sensation. I knew the man by name, and partly recognized
his features, but there all resemblance ended. From a trembling,
despairing, nervous wreck, had emerged a man brimming over with
self-reliance and contentment. I talked with him for some time, but was
not able to bring myself to feel that I had known him before. To me he
was a stranger, and so he left me. A long time has passed with no return
to alcohol.

When I need a mental uplift, I often think of another case brought in by
a physician prominent in New York City. The patient had made his own
diagnosis, and deciding his situation hopeless, had hidden in a deserted
barn determined to die. He was rescued by a searching party, and, in
desperate condition, brought to me. Following his physical
rehabilitation, he had a talk with me in which he frankly stated he
thought the treatment a waste of effort, unless I could assure him,
which no one ever had, that in the future he would have the \"will
power\" to resist the impulse to drink.

His alcoholic problem was so complex, and his depression so great, that
we felt his only hope would be through what we then called \"moral
psychology,\" and we doubted if even that would have any effect.

However, he did become \"sold\" on the ideas contained in this book. He
has not had a drink for a great many years. I see him now and then and
he is as fine a specimen of manhood as one could wish to meet.

I earnestly advise every alcoholic to read this book through, and though
perhaps he came to scoff, he may remain to pray.

William D. Silkworth, M.D.

## Bill's Story

WAR FEVER ran high in the New England town to which we new, young
officers from Plattsburg were assigned, and we were flattered when the
first citizens took us to their homes, making us feel heroic. Here was
love, applause, war; moments sublime with intervals hilarious. I was
part of life at last, and in the midst of the excitement I discovered
liquor. I forgot the strong warnings and the prejudices of my people
concerning drink. In time we sailed for \"Over There.\" I was very
lonely and again turned to alcohol.

We landed in England. I visited Winchester Cathedral. Much moved, I
wandered outside. My attention was caught by a doggerel on an old
tombstone:

> \"Here lies a Hampshire Grenadier.
>
> Who caught his death.
>
> Drinking cold small beer.
>
> A good soldier is ne'er forgot.
>
> Whether he dieth by musket.
>
> Or by pot.\"

Ominous warning-which I failed to heed.

Twenty-two, and a veteran of foreign wars, I went home at last. I
fancied myself a leader, for had not the men of my battery given me a
special token of appreciation? My talent for leadership, I imagined,
would place me at the head of vast enterprises which I would manage with
the utmost assurance.

I took a night law course, and obtained employment as investigator for a
surety company. The drive for success was on. I'd prove to the world I
was important. My work took me about Wall Street and little by little I
became interested in the market. Many people lost money-but some became
very rich. Why not I? I studied economics and business as well as law.
Potential alcoholic that I was, I nearly failed my law course. At one of
the finals I was too drunk to think or write. Though my drinking was not
yet continuous, it disturbed my wife. We had long talks when I would
still her forebodings by telling her that men of genius conceived their
best projects when drunk; that the most majestic constructions of
philosophic thought were so derived.

By the time I had completed the course, I knew the law was not for me.
The inviting maelstrom of Wall Street had me in its grip. Business and
financial leaders were my heroes. Out of this alloy of drink and
speculation, I commenced to forge the weapon that one day would turn in
its flight like a boomerang and all but cut me to ribbons. Living
modestly, my wife and I saved \$1,000. It went into certain securities,
then cheap and rather unpopular. I rightly imagined that they would some
day have a great rise. I failed to persuade my broker friends to send me
out looking over factories and managements, but my wife and I decided to
go anyway. I had developed a theory that most people lost money in
stocks through ignorance of markets. I discovered many more reasons
later on.

We gave up our positions and off we roared on a motorcycle, the sidecar
stuffed with tent, blankets, a change of clothes, and three huge volumes
of a financial reference service. Our friends thought a lunacy
commission should be appointed. Perhaps they were right. I had had some
success at speculation, so we had a little money, but we once worked on
a farm for a month to avoid drawing on our small capital. That was the
last honest manual labor on my part for many a day. We covered the whole
eastern United States in a year. At the end of it, my reports to Wall
Street procured me a position there and the use of a large expense
account. The exercise of an option brought in more money, leaving us
with a profit of several thousand dollars for that year.

For the next few years fortune threw money and applause my way. I had
arrived. My judgment and ideas were followed by many to the tune of
paper millions. The great boom of the late twenties was seething and
swelling. Drink was taking an important and exhilarating part in my
life. There was loud talk in the jazz places uptown. Everyone spent in
thousands and chattered in millions. Scoffers could scoff and be damned.
I made a host of fair-weather friends.

My drinking assumed more serious proportions, continuing all day and
almost every night. The remonstrances of my friends terminated in a row
and I became a lone wolf. There were many unhappy scenes in our
sumptuous apartment. There had been no real infidelity, for loyalty to
my wife, helped at times by extreme drunkenness, kept me out of those
scrapes.

In 1929 I contracted golf fever. We went at once to the country, my wife
to applaud while I started out to overtake Walter Hagen. Liquor caught
up with me much faster than I came up behind Walter. I began to be
jittery in the morning. Golf permitted drinking every day and every
night. It was fun to carom around the exclusive course which had
inspired such awe in me as a lad. I acquired the impeccable coat of tan
one sees upon the well-to-do. The local banker watched me whirl fat
checks in and out of his till with amused skepticism.

Abruptly in October 1929 hell broke loose on the New York stock
exchange. After one of those days of inferno, I wobbled from a hotel bar
to a brokerage office. It was eight o'clock-five hours after the market
closed. The ticker still clattered. I was staring at an inch of the tape
which bore the inscription XYZ-32. It had been 52 that morning. I was
finished and so were many friends. The papers reported men jumping to
death from the towers of High Finance. That disgusted me. I would not
jump. I went back to the bar. My friends had dropped several million
since ten o'clock-so what? Tomorrow was another day. As I drank, the old
fierce determination to win came back.

Next morning I telephoned a friend in Montreal. He had plenty of money
left and thought I had better go to Canada. By the following spring we
were living in our accustomed style. I felt like Napoleon returning from
Elba. No St. Helena for me! But drinking caught up with me again and my
generous friend had to let me go. This time we stayed broke.

We went to live with my wife's parents. I found a job; then lost it as
the result of a brawl with a taxi driver. Mercifully, no one could guess
that I was to have no real employment for five years, or hardly draw a
sober breath. My wife began to work in a department store, coming home
exhausted to find me drunk.

I became an unwelcome hanger-on at brokerage places.

Liquor ceased to be a luxury; it became a necessity. \"Bathtub\" gin,
two bottles a day, and often three, got to be routine. Sometimes a small
deal would net a few hundred dollars, and I would pay my bills at the
bars and delicatessens. This went on endlessly, and I began to waken
very early in the morning shaking violently. A tumbler full of gin
followed by half a dozen bottles of beer would be required if I were to
eat any breakfast. Nevertheless, I still thought I could control the
situation, and there were periods of sobriety which renewed my wife's
hope.

Gradually things got worse. The house was taken over by the mortgage
holder, my mother-in-law died, my wife and father-in-law became ill.

Then I got a promising business opportunity. Stocks were at the low
point of 1932, and I had somehow formed a group to buy. I was to share
generously in the profits. Then I went on a prodigious bender, and that
chance vanished.

I woke up. This had to be stopped. I saw I could not take so much as one
drink. I was through forever. Before then, I had written lots of sweet
promises, but my wife happily observed that this time I meant business.
And so I did.

Shortly afterward I came home drunk. There had been no fight. Where had
been my high resolve? I simply didn't know. It hadn't even come to mind.
Someone had pushed a drink my way, and I had taken it. Was I crazy? I
began to wonder, for such an appalling lack of perspective seemed near
being just that.

Renewing my resolve, I tried again. Some time passed, and confidence
began to be replaced by cock-sureness. I could laugh at the gin mills.
Now I had what it takes! One day I walked into a cafe to telephone. In
no time I was beating on the bar asking myself how it happened. As the
whisky rose to my head I told myself I would manage better next time,
but I might as well get good and drunk then. And I did.

The remorse, horror and hopelessness of the next morning are
unforgettable. The courage to do battle was not there. My brain raced
uncontrollably and there was a terrible sense of impending calamity. I
hardly dared cross the street, lest I collapse and be run down by an
early morning truck, for it was scarcely daylight. An all night place
supplied me with a dozen glasses of ale. My writhing nerves were stilled
at last. A morning paper told me the market had gone to hell again.
Well, so had I. The market would recover, but I wouldn't. That was a
hard thought. Should I kill myself? No-not now. Then a mental fog
settled down. Gin would fix that. So two bottles, and-oblivion.

The mind and body are marvelous mechanisms, for mine endured this agony
two more years. Sometimes I stole from my wife's slender purse when the
morning terror and madness were on me. Again I swayed dizzily before an
open window, or the medicine cabinet where there was poison, cursing
myself for a weakling. There were flights from city to country and back,
as my wife and I sought escape. Then came the night when the physical
and mental torture was so hellish I feared I would burst through my
window, sash and all. Somehow I managed to drag my mattress to a lower
floor, lest I suddenly leap. A doctor came with a heavy sedative. Next
day found me drinking both gin and sedative. This combination soon
landed me on the rocks. People feared for my sanity. So did I. I could
eat little or nothing when drinking, and I was forty pounds under
weight.

My brother-in-law is a physician, and through his kindness and that of
my mother I was placed in a nationally-known hospital for the mental and
physical rehabilitation of alcoholics. Under the so-called belladonna
treatment my brain cleared. Hydrotherapy and mild exercise helped much.
Best of all, I met a kind doctor who explained that though certainly
selfish and foolish, I had been seriously ill, bodily and mentally.

It relieved me somewhat to learn that in alcoholics the will is
amazingly weakened when it comes to combating liquor, though it often
remains strong in other respects. My incredible behavior in the face of
a desperate desire to stop was explained. Understanding myself now, I
fared forth in high hope. For three or four months the goose hung high.
I went to town regularly and even made a little money. Surely this was
the answer-self-knowledge.

But it was not, for the frightful day came when I drank once more. The
curve of my declining moral and bodily health fell off like a ski-jump.
After a time I returned to the hospital. This was the finish, the
curtain, it seemed to me. My weary and despairing wife was informed that
it would all end with heart failure during delirium tremens, or I would
develop a wet brain, perhaps within a year. She would soon have to give
me over to the undertaker or the asylum.

They did not need to tell me. I knew, and almost welcomed the idea. It
was a devastating blow to my pride. I, who had thought so well of myself
and my abilities, of my capacity to surmount obstacles, was cornered at
last. Now I was to plunge into the dark, joining that endless procession
of sots who had gone on before. I thought of my poor wife. There had
been much happiness after all. What would I not give to make amends. But
that was over now.

No words can tell of the loneliness and despair I found in that bitter
morass of self-pity. Quicksand stretched around me in all directions. I
had met my match. I had been overwhelmed. Alcohol was my master.

Trembling, I stepped from the hospital a broken man. Fear sobered me for
a bit. Then came the insidious insanity of that first drink, and on
Armistice Day 1934, I was off again. Everyone became resigned to the
certainty that I would have to be shut up somewhere, or would stumble
along to a miserable end. How dark it is before the dawn! In reality
that was the beginning of my last debauch. I was soon to be catapulted
into what I like to call the fourth dimension of existence. I was to
know happiness, peace, and usefulness, in a way of life that is
incredibly more wonderful as time passes.

Near the end of that bleak November, I sat drinking in my kitchen. With
a certain satisfaction I reflected there was enough gin concealed about
the house to carry me through that night and the next day. My wife was
at work. I wondered whether I dared hide a full bottle of gin near the
head of our bed. I would need it before daylight.

My musing was interrupted by the telephone. The cheery voice of an old
school friend asked if he might come over. He was sober. It was years
since I could remember his coming to New York in that condition. I was
amazed. Rumor had it that he had been committed for alcoholic insanity.
I wondered how he had escaped. Of course he would have dinner, and then
I could drink openly with him. Unmindful of his welfare, I thought only
of recapturing the spirit of other days. There was that time we had
chartered an airplane to complete a jag! His coming was an oasis in this
dreary desert of futility. The very thing-an oasis! Drinkers are like
that.

The door opened and he stood there, fresh-skinned and glowing. There was
something about his eyes. He was inexplicably different. What had
happened?

I pushed a drink across the table. He refused it. Disappointed but
curious, I wondered what had got into the fellow. He wasn't himself.

\"Come, what's this all about?\" I queried.

He looked straight at me. Simply, but smilingly, he said, \"I've got
religion.\"

I was aghast. So that was it-last summer an alcoholic crackpot; now, I
suspected, a little cracked about religion. He had that starry-eyed
look. Yes, the old boy was on fire all right. But bless his heart, let
him rant! Besides, my gin would last longer than his preaching.

But he did no ranting. In a matter of fact way he told how two men had
appeared in court, persuading the judge to suspend his commitment. They
had told of a simple religious idea and a practical program of action.
That was two months ago and the result was self-evident. It worked!

He had come to pass his experience along to me-if I cared to have it. I
was shocked, but interested. Certainly I was interested. I had to be,
for I was hopeless.

He talked for hours. Childhood memories rose before me. I could almost
hear the sound of the preacher's voice as I sat, on still Sundays, way
over there on the hillside; there was that proffered temperance pledge I
never signed; my grandfather's good natured contempt of some church folk
and their doings; his insistence that the spheres really had their
music; but his denial of the preacher's right to tell him how he must
listen; his fearlessness as he spoke of these things just before he
died; these recollections welled up from the past. They made me swallow
hard.

That war-time day in old Winchester Cathedral came back again.

I had always believed in a Power greater than myself. I had often
pondered these things. I was not an atheist. Few people really are, for
that means blind faith in the strange proposition that this universe
originated in a cipher and aimlessly rushes nowhere. My intellectual
heroes, the chemists, the astronomers, even the evolutionists, suggested
vast laws and forces at work. Despite contrary indications, I had little
doubt that a mighty purpose and rhythm underlay all. How could there be
so much of precise and immutable law, and no intelligence? I simply had
to believe in a Spirit of the Universe, who knew neither time nor
limitation. But that was as far as I had gone.

With ministers, and the world's religions, I parted right there. When
they talked of a God personal to me, who was love, superhuman strength
and direction, I became irritated and my mind snapped shut against such
a theory.

To Christ I conceded the certainty of a great man, not too closely
followed by those who claimed Him. His moral teaching-most excellent.
For myself, I had adopted those parts which seemed convenient and not
too difficult; the rest I disregarded.

The wars which had been fought, the burnings and chicanery that
religious dispute had facilitated, made me sick. I honestly doubted
whether, on balance, the religions of mankind had done any good. Judging
from what I had seen in Europe and since, the power of God in human
affairs was negligible, the Brotherhood of Man a grim jest. If there was
a Devil, he seemed the Boss Universal, and he certainly had me.

But my friend sat before me, and he made the point-blank declaration
that God had done for him what he could not do for himself. His human
will had failed. Doctors had pronounced him incurable. Society was about
to lock him up. Like myself, he had admitted complete defeat. Then he
had, in effect, been raised from the dead, suddenly taken from the scrap
heap to a level of life better than the best he had ever known!

Had this power originated in him? Obviously it had not. There had been
no more power in him than there was in me at the minute; and this was
none at all.

That floored me. It began to look as though religious people were right
after all. Here was something at work in a human heart which had done
the impossible. My ideas about miracles were drastically revised right
then. Never mind the musty past; here sat a miracle directly across the
kitchen table. He shouted great tidings.

I saw that my friend was much more than inwardly reorganized. He was on
a different footing. His roots grasped a new soil.

Despite the living example of my friend there remained in me the
vestiges of my old prejudice. The word God still aroused a certain
antipathy. When the thought was expressed that there might be a God
personal to me this feeling was intensified. I didn't like the idea. I
could go for such conceptions as Creative Intelligence, Universal Mind
or Spirit of Nature but I resisted the thought of a Czar of the Heavens,
however loving His sway might be. I have since talked with scores of men
who felt the same way.

My friend suggested what then seemed a novel idea. He said, \"Why don't
you choose your own conception of God?\"

That statement hit me hard. It melted the icy intellectual mountain in
whose shadow I had lived and shivered many years. I stood in the
sunlight at last.

It was only a matter of being willing to believe in a Power greater than
myself. Nothing more was required of me to make my beginning. I saw that
growth could start from that point. Upon a foundation of complete
willingness I might build what I saw in my friend. Would I have it? Of
course I would!

Thus was I convinced that God is concerned with us humans when we want
Him enough. At long last I saw, I felt, I believed. Scales of pride and
prejudice fell from my eyes. A new world came into view.

The real significance of my experience in the Cathedral burst upon me.
For a brief moment, I had needed and wanted God. There had been a humble
willingness to have Him with me-and He came. But soon the sense of His
presence had been blotted out by worldly clamors, mostly those within
myself. And so it had been ever since. How blind I had been.

At the hospital I was separated from alcohol for the last time.
Treatment seemed wise, for I showed signs of delirium tremens.

There I humbly offered myself to God, as I then understood Him, to do
with me as He would. I placed myself unreservedly under His care and
direction. I admitted for the first time that of myself I was nothing;
that without Him I was lost. I ruthlessly faced my sins and became
willing to have my new-found Friend take them away, root and branch. I
have not had a drink since.

My schoolmate visited me, and I fully acquainted him with my problems
and deficiencies. We made a list of people I had hurt or toward whom I
felt resentment. I expressed my entire willingness to approach these
individuals, admitting my wrong. Never was I to be critical of them. I
was to right all such matters to the utmost of my ability.

I was to test my thinking by the new God-consciousness within. Common
sense would thus become uncommon sense. I was to sit quietly when in
doubt, asking only for direction and strength to meet my problems as He
would have me. Never was I to pray for myself, except as my requests
bore on my usefulness to others. Then only might I expect to receive.
But that would be in great measure.

My friend promised when these things were done I would enter upon a new
relationship with my Creator; that I would have the elements of a way of
living which answered all my problems. Belief in the power of God, plus
enough willingness, honesty and humility to establish and maintain the
new order of things, were the essential requirements.

Simple, but not easy; a price had to be paid. It meant destruction of
self-centeredness. I must turn in all things to the Father of Light who
presides over us all.

These were revolutionary and drastic proposals, but the moment I fully
accepted them, the effect was electric. There was a sense of victory,
followed by such a peace and serenity as I had never known. There was
utter confidence. I felt lifted up, as though the great clean wind of a
mountain top blew through and through. God comes to most men gradually,
but His impact on me was sudden and profound.

For a moment I was alarmed, and called my friend, the doctor, to ask if
I were still sane. He listened in wonder as I talked.

Finally he shook his head saying,

> \"Something has happened to you I don't understand. But you had better
> hang on to it. Anything is better than the way you were.\"

The good doctor now sees many men who have such experiences. He knows
that they are real.

While I lay in the hospital the thought came that there were thousands
of hopeless alcoholics who might be glad to have what had been so freely
given me. Perhaps I could help some of them. They in turn might work
with others.

My friend had emphasized the absolute necessity of demonstrating these
principles in all my affairs. Particularly was it imperative to work
with others as he had worked with me. Faith without works was dead, he
said. And how appallingly true for the alcoholic! For if an alcoholic
failed to perfect and enlarge his spiritual life through work and
self-sacrifice for others, he could not survive the certain trials and
low spots ahead. If he did not work, he would surely drink again, and if
he drank, he would surely die. Then faith would be dead indeed. With us
it is just like that.

My wife and I abandoned ourselves with enthusiasm to the idea of helping
other alcoholics to a solution of their problems. It was fortunate, for
my old business associates remained skeptical for a year and a half,
during which I found little work. I was not too well at the time, and
was plagued by waves of self-pity and resentment. This sometimes nearly
drove me back to drink, but I soon found that when all other measures
failed, work with another alcoholic would save the day. Many times I
have gone to my old hospital in despair. On talking to a man there, I
would be amazingly lifted up and set on my feet. It is a design for
living that works in rough going.

We commenced to make many fast friends and a fellowship has grown up
among us of which it is a wonderful thing to feel a part. The joy of
living we really have, even under pressure and difficulty. I have seen
hundreds of families set their feet in the path that really goes
somewhere; have seen the most impossible domestic situations righted;
feuds and bitterness of all sorts wiped out. I have seen men come out of
asylums and resume a vital place in the lives of their families and
communities. Business and professional men have regained their standing.
There is scarcely any form of trouble and misery which has not been
overcome among us. In one western city and its environs there are one
thousand of us and our families. We meet frequently so that newcomers
may find the fellowship they seek. At these informal gatherings one may
often see from 50 to 200 persons. We are growing in numbers and power.

An alcoholic in his cups is an unlovely creature. Our struggles with
them are variously strenuous, comic, and tragic. One poor chap committed
suicide in my home. He could not, or would not, see our way of life.

There is, however a vast amount of fun about it all. I suppose some
would be shocked at our seeming worldliness and levity. But just
underneath there is deadly earnestness. Faith has to work twenty-four
hours a day in and through us, or we perish.

Most of us feel we need look no further for Utopia. We have it with us
right here and now. Each day my friend's simple talk in our kitchen
multiplies itself in a widening circle of peace on earth and good will
to men.

## There is a Solution

We, of Alcoholics Anonymous, know thousands of men and women who were
once just as hopeless as Bill. Nearly all have recovered. They have
solved the drink problem.

We are average Americans. All sections of this country and many of its
occupations are represented, as well as many political, economic,
social, and religious backgrounds. We are people who normally would not
mix. But there exists among us a fellowship, a friendliness, and an
understanding which is indescribably wonderful. We are like the
passengers of a great liner the moment after rescue from shipwreck when
camaraderie, joyousness and democracy pervade the vessel from steerage
to Captain's table. Unlike the feelings of the ship's passengers,
however, our joy in escape from disaster does not subside as we go our
individual ways. The feeling of having shared in a common peril is one
element in the powerful cement which binds us. But that in itself would
never have held us together as we are now joined.

The tremendous fact for every one of us is that we have discovered a
common solution. We have a way out on which we can absolutely agree, and
upon which we can join in brotherly and harmonious action. This is the
great news this book carries to those who suffer from alcoholism. An
illness of this sort and we have come to believe it an illness involves
those about us in a way no other human sickness can. If a person has
cancer all are sorry for him and no one is angry or hurt. But not so
with the alcoholic illness, for with it there goes annihilation of all
the things worth while in life. It engulfs all whose lives touch the
sufferer's. It brings misunderstanding, fierce resentment, financial
insecurity, disgusted friends and employers, warped lives of blameless
children, sad wives and parents anyone can increase the list.

We hope this volume will inform and comfort those who are, or who may be
affected. There are many.

Highly competent psychiatrists who have dealt with us have found it
sometimes impossible to persuade an alcoholic to discuss his situation
without reserve. Strangely enough, wives, parents and intimate friends
usually find us even more unapproachable than do the psychiatrist and
the doctor.

But the ex-problem drinker who has found this solution, who is properly
armed with facts about himself, can generally win the entire confidence
of another alcoholic in a few hours. Until such an understanding is
reached, little or nothing can be accomplished.

That the man who is making the approach has had the same difficulty,
that he obviously knows what he is talking about, that his whole
deportment shouts at the new prospect that he is a man with a real
answer, that he has no attitude of Holier Than Thou, nothing whatever
except the sincere desire to be helpful; that there are no fees to pay,
no axes to grind, no people to please, no lectures to be endured these
are the conditions we have found most effective. After such an approach
many take up their beds and walk again.

None of us makes a sole vocation of this work, nor do we think its
effectiveness would be increased if we did. We feel that elimination of
our drinking is but a beginning. A much more important demonstration of
our principles lies before us in our respective homes, occupations and
affairs. All of us spend much of our spare time in the sort of effort
which we are going to describe. A few are fortunate enough to be so
situated that they can give nearly all their time to the work.

If we keep on the way we are going there is little doubt that much good
will result, but the surface of the problem would hardly be scratched.
Those of us who live in large cities are overcome by the reflection that
close by hundreds are dropping into oblivion every day. Many could
recover if they had the opportunity we have enjoyed. How then shall we
present that which has been so freely given us?

We have concluded to publish an anonymous volume setting forth the
problem as we see it. We shall bring to the task our combined experience
and knowledge. This should suggest a useful program for anyone concerned
with a drinking problem.

Of necessity there will have to be discussion of matters medical,
psychiatric, social, and religious. We are aware that these matters are
from their very nature, controversial. Nothing would please us so much
as to write a book which would contain no basis for contention or
argument. We shall do our utmost to achieve that ideal. Most of us sense
that real tolerance of other people's shortcomings and viewpoints and a
respect for their opinions are attitudes which make us more useful to
others. Our very lives, as ex-problem drinkers, depend upon our constant
thought of others and how we may help meet their needs.

You may already have asked yourself why it is that all of us became so
very ill from drinking. Doubtless you are curious to discover how and
why, in the face of expert opinion to the contrary, we have recovered
from a hopeless condition of mind and body. If you are an alcoholic who
wants to get over it, you may already be asking \"What do I have to
do?\"

It is the purpose of this book to answer such questions specifically. We
shall tell you what we have done. Before going into a detailed
discussion, it may be well to summarize some points as we see them.

How many time people have said to us: \"I can take it or leave it alone.
Why can't he?\" \"Why don't you drink like a gentleman or quit?\" \"That
fellow can't handle his liquor.\" \"Why don't you try beer and wine?\"
\"Lay off the hard stuff.\" \"His will power must be weak.\" \"He could
stop if he wanted to.\" \"She's such a sweet girl, I should think he'd
stop for her sake.\" \"The doctor told him that if he ever drank again
it would kill him, but there he is all lit up again.\"

Now these are commonplace observations on drinkers which we hear all the
time. Back of them is a world of ignorance and misunderstanding. We see
that these expressions refer to people whose reactions are very
different from ours.

Moderate drinkers have little trouble in giving up liquor entirely if
they have good reason for it. They can take it or leave it alone.

Then we have a certain type of hard drinker. He may have the habit badly
enough to gradually impair him physically and mentally. It may cause him
to die a few years before his time. If a sufficiently strong reason ill
health, falling in love, change of environment, or the warning of a
doctor becomes operative, this man can also stop or moderate, although
he may find it difficult and troublesome and may even need medical
attention.

But what about the real alcoholic? He may start off as a moderate
drinker; he may or may not become a continuous hard drinker; but at some
stage of his drinking career he begins to lose all control of his liquor
consumption, once he starts to drink.

Here is a fellow who has been puzzling you, especially in his lack of
control. He does absurd, incredible, tragic things while drinking. He is
a real Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. He is seldom mildly intoxicated. He is
always more or less insanely drunk. His disposition while drinking
resembles his normal nature but little. He may be one of the finest
fellows in the world. Yet let him drink for a day, and he frequently
becomes disgustingly, and even dangerously anti-social. He has a
positive genius for getting tight at exactly the wrong moment,
particularly when some important decision must be made or engagement
kept. He is often perfectly sensible and well balanced concerning
everything except liquor, but in that respect he is incredibly dishonest
and selfish. He often possesses special abilities, skills, and
aptitudes, and has a promising career ahead of him. He uses his gifts to
build up a bright outlook for his family and himself, and then pulls the
structure down on his head by a senseless series of sprees. He is the
fellow who goes to bed so intoxicated he ought to sleep the clock
around. Yet early next morning he searches madly for the bottle he
misplace the night before. If he can afford it, he may have liquor
concealed all over his house to be certain no one gets his entire supply
away from him to throw down the wastepipe. As matters grow worse, he
begins to use a combination of high-powered sedative and liquor to quiet
his nerves so he can go to work. Then comes the day when he simply
cannot make it and gets drunk all over again. Perhaps he goes to a
doctor who gives him morphine or some sedative with which to taper off.
Then he begins to appear at hospitals and sanitariums.

This is by no means a comprehensive picture of the true alcoholic, as
our behavior patterns vary. But this description should identify him
roughly.

Why does he behave like this? If hundreds of experiences have shown him
that one drink means another debacle with all its attendant suffering
and humiliation, why is it he takes that one drink? Why can't he stay on
the water wagon? What has become of the common sense and will power that
he still sometimes displays with respect to other matters?

Perhaps there never will be a full answer to these questions. Opinions
vary considerably as to why the alcoholic reacts differently from normal
people. We are not sure why, once a certain point is reached, little can
be done for him. We cannot answer the riddle.

We know that while the alcoholic keeps away from drink, as he may do for
months or years, he reacts much like other men. We are equally positive
that once he takes any alcohol whatever into his system, something
happens, both in the bodily and mental sense, which makes it virtually
impossible for him to stop. The experience of any alcoholic will
abundantly confirm this.

These observations would be academic and pointless if our friend never
took the first drink, thereby setting the terrible cycle in motion.
Therefore, the main problem of the alcoholic centers in his mind, rather
than in his body. If you ask him why he started on that last bender, the
chances are he will offer you any one of a hundred alibis. Sometimes
these excuses have a certain plausibility, but none of them really makes
sense in the light of the havoc an alcoholic's drinking bout creates.
They sound like the philosophy of the man who, having a headache, beats
himself on the head with a hammer so that he can't feel the ache. If you
draw this fallacious reasoning to the attention of an alcoholic, he will
laugh it off, or become irritated and refuse to talk.

Once in a while he may tell the truth. And the truth, strange to say, is
usually that he has no more idea why he took that first drink than you
have. Some drinkers have excuses with which they are satisfied part of
the time. But in their hearts they really do not know why they do it.
Once this malady has a real hold, they are a baffled lot. There is the
obsession that somehow, someday, they will beat the game. But they often
suspect they are down for the count.

How true this is, few realize. In a vague way their families and friends
sense that these drinkers are abnormal, but everybody hopefully awaits
the day when the sufferer will rouse himself from his lethargy and
assert his power of will.

The tragic truth is that if the man be a real alcoholic, the happy day
may not arrive. He has lost control. At a certain point in the drinking
of every alcoholic, he passes into a state where the most powerful
desire to stop drinking is of absolutely no avail. This tragic situation
has already arrived in practically every case long before it is
suspected.

The fact is that most alcoholics, for reasons yet obscure, have lost the
power of choice in drink. Our so called will power becomes practically
nonexistent. We are unable, at certain times, to bring into our
consciousness with sufficient force the memory of the suffering and
humiliation of even a week or a month ago. We are without defense
against the first drink.

The almost certain consequences that follow taking even a glass of beer
do not crowd into the mind to deter us. If these thoughts occur, they
are hazy and readily supplanted with the old threadbare idea that this
time we shall handle ourselves like other people. There is a complete
failure of the kind of defense that keeps one from putting his hand on a
hot stove.

The alcoholic may say to himself in the most casual way, \"It won't burn
me this time, so here's how!\". Or perhaps he doesn't think at all. How
often have some of us begun to drink in this nonchalant way, and after
the third or fourth, pounded on the bar and said to ourselves, \"For
God's sake, how did I ever get started again?\". Only to have that
thought supplanted by \"Well, I'll stop with the sixth drink.\" Or
\"What's the use anyhow?\"

When this sort of thinking is fully established in an individual with
alcoholic tendencies, he has probably placed himself beyond human aid,
and unless locked up, may die or go permanently insane. These stark and
ugly facts have been confirmed by legions of alcohoholics throughout
history. But for the grace of God, there would have been thousands more
convincing demonstrations. So many want to stop but cannot.

There is a solution. Almost none of us liked the self-searching, the
leveling of our pride, the confession of shortcomings which the process
requires for its successful consummation. But we saw that it really
worked in others, and we had come to believe in the hopelessness and
futility of life as we had been living it. When, therefore, we were
approached by those in whom the problem had been solved, there was
nothing left for us but to pick up the simple kit of spiritual tools
laid at out feet. We have found much of heaven and we have been rocketed
into a fourth dimension of existence of which we had not even dreamed.

The great fact is just this, and nothing less: That we have had deep and
effective spiritual experiences\* which have revolutionized our whole
attitude toward life, toward our fellows and toward God's universe. The
central fact of our lives today is the absolute certainty that our
Creator has entered into our hearts and lives in a way which is indeed
miraculous. He has commenced to accomplish those things for us which we
could never do by ourselves.

If you are as seriously alcoholic as we were, we believe there is no
middle-of-the-road solution. We were in a position where life was
becoming impossible, and if we had passed into the region from which
there is no return through human aid, we had but two alternatives: One
was to go on to the bitter end, blotting out the consciousness of our
intolerable situation as best we could; and the other, to accept
spiritual help. This we did because we honestly wanted to, and were
willing to make the effort.

A certain American business man had ability, good sense, and high
character. For years he had floundered from one sanitarium to another.
He had consulted the best known American psychiatrists. Then he had gone
to Europe, placing himself in the care of a celebrated physician (the
psychiatrist, Dr. Jung) who prescribed for him. Though experience had
made him skeptical, he finished his treatment with unusual confidence.
His physical and mental condition were unusually good. Above all, he
believed he had acquired such a profound knowledge of the inner workings
of his mind and its hidden springs that relapse was unthinkable.
Nevertheless, he was drunk in a short time. More baffling still, he
could give himself no satisfactory explanation for his fall.

So he returned to this doctor, whom he admired, and asked him
point-blank why he could not recover. He wished above all things to
regain self-control. He seemed quite rational and well-balanced with
respect to other problems. Yet he had no control whatever over alcohol.
Why was this?

He begged the doctor to tell him the whole truth, and he got it. In the
doctor's judgment he was utterly hopeless; he could never regain his
position in society and he would have to place himself under lock and
key or hire a bodyguard if he expected to live long. That was a great
physician's opinion.

But this man still lives, and is a free man. He does not need a
bodyguard nor is he confined. He can go anywhere on this earth where
other free men may go without disaster, provided he remains willing to
maintain a certain simple attitude.

Some of our alcoholic readers may think they can do without spiritual
help. Let us tell you the rest of the conversation our friend had with
his doctor.

The doctor said: *\"You have the mind of a chronic alcoholic. I have
never seen one single case recover, where that state of mind existed to
the extent that it does in you.\"* Our friend felt as though the gates
of hell had closed on him with a clang.

He said to the doctor, \"Is there no exception?\"

*\"Yes,\" replied the doctor, \"there is. Exceptions to cases such as
yours have been occurring since early times. Here and there, once in a
while, alcoholics have had what are called vital spiritual experiences.
To me these occurrences are phenomena. They appear to be in the nature
of huge emotional displacements and rearrangements. Ideas, emotions, and
attitudes which were once the guiding forces of the lives of these men
are suddenly cast to one side, and a completely new set of conceptions
and motives begin to dominate them. In fact, I have been trying to
produce some such emotional rearrangement within you. With many
individuals the methods which I employed are successful, but I have
never been successful with an alcoholic of your description.\"*

Upon hearing this, our friend was somewhat relieved, for he reflected
that, after all, he was a good church member. This hope, however, was
destroyed by the doctor's telling him that while his religious
convictions were very good, in his case they did not spell the necessary
vital spiritual experience.

Here was the terrible dilemma in which our friend found himself when he
had the extraordinary experience, which as we have already told you,
made him a free man.

We, in our turn, sought the same escape with all the desperation of
drowning men. What seemed at first a flimsy reed, has proved to be the
loving and powerful hand of God. A new life has been given us or, if you
prefer, \"a design for living\" that really works.

The distinguished American psychologist, William James, in his book
\"Varieties of Religious Experience,\" indicates a multitude of ways in
which men have discovered God. We have no desire to convince anyone that
there is only one way by which faith can be acquired. If what we have
learned and felt and seen means anything at all, it means that all of
us, whatever our race, creed, or color are the children of a living
Creator with whom we may form a relationship upon simple and
understandable terms as soon as we are willing and honest enough to try.
Those having religious affiliations will find here nothing disturbing to
their beliefs or ceremonies. There is no friction among us over such
matters.

We think it no concern of ours what religious bodies our members
identify themselves with as individuals. This should be an entirely
personal affair which each one decides for himself in the light of past
associations, or his present choice. Not all of us join religious
bodies, but most of us favor such memberships.

In the following chapter, there appears an explanation of alcoholism, as
we understand it, then a chapter addressed to the agnostic. Many who
once were in this class are now among our members. Surprisingly enough,
we find such convictions no great obstacle to a spiritual experience.

Further on, clear-cut directions are given showing how we recovered.
These are followed by three dozen personal experiences.

Each individual, in the personal stories, describes in his own language
and from his own point of view the way he established his relationship
with God. These give a fair cross section of our membership and a
clear-cut idea of what has actually happened in their lives.

We hope no one will consider these self-revealing accounts in bad taste.
Our hope is that many alcoholic men and women, desperately in need, will
see these pages, and we believe that it is only by fully disclosing
ourselves and our problems that they will be persuaded to say, \"Yes, I
am one of them too; I must have this thing.\"

## More About Alcoholism

MOST OF us have been unwilling to admit we were real alcoholics. No
person likes to think he is bodily and mentally different from his
fellows. Therefore, it is not surprising that our drinking careers have
been characterized by countless vain attempts to prove we could drink
like other people. The idea that somehow, someday he will control and
enjoy his drinking is the great obsession of every abnormal drinker. The
persistence of this illusion is astonishing. Many pursue it into the
gates of insanity or death.

We learned that we had to fully concede to our innermost selves that we
were alcoholics. This is the first step in recovery. The delusion that
we are like other people, or presently may be, has to be smashed.

We alcoholics are men and women who have lost the ability to control our
drinking. We know that no real alcoholic ever recovers control. All of
us felt at times that we were regaining control, but such
intervals-usually brief-were inevitably followed by still less control,
which led in time to pitiful and incomprehensible demoralization. We are
convinced to a man that alcoholics of our type are in the grip of a
progressive illness. Over any considerable period we get worse, never
better.

We are like men who have lost their legs; they never grow new ones.
Neither does there appear to be any kind of treatment which will make
alcoholics of our kind like other men. We have tried every imaginable
remedy. In some instances there has been brief recovery, followed always
by a still worse relapse. Physicians who are familiar with alcoholism
agree there is no such thing as making a normal drinker out of an
alcoholic. Science may one day accomplish this, but it hasn't done so
yet.

Despite all we can say, many who are real alcoholics are not going to
believe they are in that class. By every form of self-deception and
experimentation, they will try to prove themselves exceptions to the
rule, therefore nonalcoholic. If anyone who is showing inability to
control his drinking can do the right-about-face and drink like a
gentleman, our hats are off to him. Heaven knows, we have tried hard
enough and long enough to drink like other people!

Here are some of the methods we have tried: Drinking beer only, limiting
the number of drinks, never drinking alone, never drinking in the
morning, drinking only at home, never having it in the house, never
drinking during business hours, drinking only at parties, switching from
scotch to brandy, drinking only natural wines, agreeing to resign if
ever drunk on the job, taking a trip, not taking a trip, swearing off
forever (with and without a solemn oath), taking more physical exercise,
reading inspirational books, going to health farms and sanitariums,
accepting voluntary commitment to asylums -we could increase the list ad
infinitum.

We do not like to pronounce any individual as an alcoholic, but you can
quickly diagnose yourself. Step over to the nearest bar-room and try
some controlled drinking. Try to drink and stop abruptly. Try it more
than once. It will not take long for you to decide, if you are honest
with yourself about it. It may be worth a bad case of jitters if you get
a full knowledge of your condition. Though there is no way of proving
it, we believe that early in our drinking careers most of us could have
stopped drinking. But the difficulty is that few alcoholics have enough
desire to stop while there is yet time. We have heard of a few instances
where people, who showed definite signs of alcoholism, were able to stop
for a long period because of an overpowering desire to do so. Here is
one.

A man of thirty was doing a great deal of spree drinking. He was very
nervous in the morning after these bouts and quieted himself with more
liquor. He was ambitious to succeed in business, but saw that he would
get nowhere if he drank at all. Once he started, he had no control
whatever. He made up his mind that until he had been successful in
business and had retired, he would not touch another drop. An
exceptional man, he remained bone dry for twenty-five years and retired
at the age of fifty-five, after a successful and happy business career.
Then he fell victim to a belief which practically every alcoholic has
-that his long period of sobriety and self-discipline had qualified him
to drink as other men. Out came his carpet slippers and a bottle. In two
months he was in a hospital, puzzled and humiliated. He tried to
regulate his drinking for a while, making several trips to the hospital
meantime. Then, gathering all his forces, he attempted to stop
altogether and found he could not. Every means of solving his problem
which money could buy was at his disposal. Every attempt failed. Though
a robust man at retirement, he went to pieces quickly and was dead
within four years.

This case contains a powerful lesson. Most of us have believed that if
we remained sober for a long stretch, we could thereafter drink
normally. But here is a man who at fifty-five years found he was just
where he had left off at thirty. We have seen the truth demonstrated
again and again: *\"Once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic.\"*
Commencing to drink after a period of sobriety, we are in a short time
as bad as ever. If we are planning to stop drinking, there must be no
reservation of any kind, nor any lurking notion that someday we will be
immune to alcohol.

Young people may be encouraged by this man's experience to think that
they can stop, as he did, on their own will power. We doubt if many of
them can do it, because none will really want to stop, and hardly one of
them, because of the peculiar mental twist already acquired, will find
he can win out. Several of our crowd, men of thirty or less, had been
drinking only a few years, but they found themselves as helpless as
those who had been drinking twenty years.

To be gravely affected, one does not necessarily have to drink a long
time nor take the quantities some of us have. This is particularly true
of women. Potential female alcoholics often turn into the real thing and
are gone beyond recall in a few years. Certain drinkers, who would be
greatly insulted if called alcoholics, are astonished at their inability
to stop. We, who are familiar with the symptoms, see large numbers of
potential alcoholics among young people everywhere. But try and get them
to see it!

As we look back, we feel we had gone on drinking many years beyond the
point where we could quit on our will power. If anyone questions whether
he has entered this dangerous area, let him try leaving liquor alone for
one year. If he is a real alcoholic and very far advanced, there is
scant chance of success. In the early days of our drinking we
occasionally remained sober for a year or more, becoming serious
drinkers again later. Though you may be able to stop for a considerable
period, you may yet be a potential alcoholic. We think few, to whom this
book will appeal, can stay dry anything like a year. Some will be drunk
the day after making their resolutions; most of them within a few weeks.

For those who are unable to drink moderately the question is how to stop
altogether. We are assuming, of course, that the reader desires to stop.
Whether such a person can quit upon a nonspiritual basis depends upon
the extent to which he has already lost the power to choose whether he
will drink or not. Many of us felt that we had plenty of character.
There was a tremendous urge to cease forever. Yet we found it
impossible. This is the baffling feature of alcoholism as we know
it-this utter inability to leave it alone, no matter how great the
necessity or the wish.

How then shall we help our readers determine, to their own satisfaction,
whether they are one of us? The experiment of quitting for a period of
time will be helpful, but we think we can render an even greater service
to alcoholic sufferers and perhaps to the medical fraternity. So we
shall describe some of the mental states that precede a relapse into
drinking, for obviously this is the crux of the problem.

What sort of thinking dominates an alcoholic who repeats time after time
the desperate experiment of the first drink? Friends who have reasoned
with him after a spree which has brought him to the point of divorce or
bankruptcy are mystified when he walks directly into a saloon. Why does
he? Of what is he thinking?

Our first example is a friend we shall call Jim. This man has a charming
wife and family. He inherited a lucrative automobile agency. He had a
commendable World War record. He is a good salesman. Everybody likes
him. He is an intelligent man, normal so far as we can see, except for a
nervous disposition. He did no drinking until he was thirty-five. In a
few years he became so violent when intoxicated that he had to be
committed. On leaving the asylum he came into contact with us.

We told him what we knew of alcoholism and the answer we had found. He
made a beginning. His family was re-assembled, and he began to work as a
salesman for the business he had lost through drinking. All went well
for a time, but he failed to enlarge his spiritual life. To his
consternation, he found himself drunk half a dozen times in rapid
succession. On each of these occasions we worked with him, reviewing
carefully what had happened. He agreed he was a real alcoholic and in a
serious condition. He knew he faced another trip to the asylum if he
kept on. Moreover, he would lose his family for whom he had a deep
affection.

Yet he got drunk again. We asked him to tell us exactly how it happened.
This is his story:

*\"I came to work on Tuesday morning. I remember I felt irritated that I
had to be a salesman for a concern I once owned. I had a few words with
the boss, but nothing serious. Then I decided to drive into the country
and see one of my prospects for a car. On the way I felt hungry so I
stopped at a roadside place where they have a bar. I had no intention of
drinking. I just thought I would get a sandwich. I also had the notion
that I might find a customer for a car at this place, which was familiar
for I had been going to it for years. I had eaten there many times
during the months I was sober. I sat down at a table and ordered a
sandwich and a glass of milk. Still no thought of drinking. I ordered
another sandwich and decided to have another glass of milk.\"*

*\"Suddenly the thought crossed my mind that if I were to put an ounce
of whiskey in my milk it couldn't hurt me on a full stomach. I ordered a
whiskey and poured it into the milk. I vaguely sensed I was not being
any too smart, but felt reassured as I was taking the whiskey on a full
stomach. The experiment went so well that I ordered another whiskey and
poured it into more milk. That didn't seem to bother me so I tried
another.\"*

Thus started one more journey to the asylum for Jim. Here was the threat
of commitment, the loss of family and position, to say nothing of that
intense mental and physical suffering which drinking always caused him.
He had much knowledge about himself as an alcoholic. Yet all reasons for
not drinking were easily pushed aside in favor of the foolish idea that
he could take whiskey if only he mixed it with milk!

Whatever the precise definition of the word may be, we call this plain
insanity. How can such a lack of proportion, of the ability to think
straight, be called anything else?

You may think this an extreme case. To us it is not far-fetched, for
this kind of thinking has been characteristic of every single one of us.
We have sometimes reflected more than Jim did upon the consequences. But
there was always the curious mental phenomenon that parallel with our
sound reasoning there inevitably ran some insanely trivial excuse for
taking the first drink. Our sound reasoning failed to hold us in check.
The insane idea won out. Next day we would ask ourselves, in all
earnestness and sincerity, how it could have happened.

In some circumstances we have gone out deliberately to get drunk,
feeling ourselves justified by nervousness, anger, worry, depression,
jealousy or the like. But even in this type of beginning we are obliged
to admit that our justification for a spree was insanely insufficient in
the light of what always happened. We now see that when we began to
drink deliberately, instead of casually, there was little serious or
effective thought during the period of premeditation of what the
terrific consequences might be.

Our behavior is as absurd and incomprehensible with respect to the first
drink as that of an individual with a passion, say, for jay-walking. He
gets a thrill out of skipping in front of fast-moving vehicles. He
enjoys himself for a few years in spite of friendly warnings. Up to this
point you would label him as a foolish chap having queer ideas of fun.
Luck then deserts him and he is slightly injured several times in
succession. You would expect him, if he were normal, to cut it out.
Presently he is hit again and this time has a fractured skull. Within a
week after leaving the hospital a fast-moving trolley car breaks his
arm. He tells you he has decided to stop jay-walking for good, but in a
few weeks he breaks both legs.

On through the years this conduct continues, accompanied by his
continual promises to be careful or to keep off the streets altogether.
Finally, he can no longer work, his wife gets a divorce and he is held
up to ridicule. He tries every known means to get the jay-walking idea
out of his head. He shuts himself up in an asylum, hoping to mend his
ways. But the day he comes out he races in front of a fire engine, which
breaks his back. Such a man would be crazy, wouldn't he?

You may think our illustration is too ridiculous. But is it? We, who
have been through the wringer, have to admit if we substituted
alcoholism for jay-walking, the illustration would fit us exactly.
However intelligent we may have been in other respects, where alcohol
has been involved, we have been strangely insane. It's strong
language-but isn't it true?

Some of you are thinking: \"Yes, what you tell us is true, but it
doesn't fully apply. We admit we have some of these symptoms, but we
have not gone to the extremes you fellows did, nor are we likely to, for
we understand ourselves so well after what you have told us that such
things cannot happen again. We have not lost everything in life through
drinking and we certainly do not intend to. Thanks for the
information.\"

That may be true of certain nonalcoholic people who, though drinking
foolishly and heavily at the present time, are able to stop or moderate,
because their brains and bodies have not been damaged as ours were. But
the actual or potential alcoholic, with hardly an exception, will be
absolutely unable to stop drinking on the basis of self-knowledge. This
is a point we wish to emphasize and re-emphasize, to smash home upon our
alcoholic readers as it has been revealed to us out of bitter
experience. Let us take another illustration.

Fred is partner in a well known accounting firm. His income is good, he
has a fine home, is happily married and the father of promising children
of college age. He has so attractive a personality that he makes friends
with everyone. If ever there was a successful business man, it is Fred.
To all appearance he is a stable, well balanced individual. Yet, he is
alcoholic. We first saw Fred about a year ago in a hospital where he had
gone to recover from a bad case of jitters. It was his first experience
of this kind, and he was much ashamed of it. Far from admitting he was
an alcoholic, he told himself he came to the hospital to rest his
nerves. The doctor intimated strongly that he might be worse than he
realized. For a few days he was depressed about his condition. He made
up his mind to quit drinking altogether. It never occurred to him that
perhaps he could not do so, in spite of his character and standing. Fred
would not believe himself an alcoholic, much less accept a spiritual
remedy for his problem. We told him what we knew about alcoholism. He
was interested and conceded that he had some of the symptoms, but he was
a long way from admitting that he could do nothing about it himself. He
was positive that this humiliating experience, plus the knowledge he had
acquired, would keep him sober the rest of his life. Self-knowledge
would fix it.

We heard no more of Fred for a while. One day we were told that he was
back in the hospital. This time he was quite shaky. He soon indicated he
was anxious to see us. The story he told is most instructive, for here
was a chap absolutely convinced he had to stop drinking, who had no
excuse for drinking, who exhibited splendid judgment and determination
in all his other concerns, yet was flat on his back nevertheless.

Let him tell you about it:

*\"I was much impressed with what you fellows said about alcoholism, and
I frankly did not believe it would be possible for me to drink again. I
rather appreciated your ideas about the subtle insanity which precedes
the first drink, but I was confident it could not happen to me after
what I had learned. I reasoned I was not so far advanced as most of you
fellows, that I had been usually successful in licking my other personal
problems, and that I would therefore be successful where you men failed.
I felt I had every right to be self-confident, that it would be only a
matter of exercising my will power and keeping on guard.*

*\"In this frame of mind, I went about my business and for a time all
was well. I had no trouble refusing drinks, and began to wonder if I had
not been making too hard work of a simple matter. One day I went to
Washington to present some accounting evidence to a government bureau. I
had been out of town before during this particular dry spell, so there
was nothing new about that. Physically, I felt fine. Neither did I have
any pressing problems or worries. My business came off well, I was
pleased and knew my partners would be too. It was the end of a perfect
day, not a cloud on the horizon.\"*

*\"I went to my hotel and leisurely dressed for dinner. As I crossed the
threshold of the dining room, the thought came to mind that it would be
nice to have a couple of cocktails with dinner. That was all. Nothing
more. I ordered a cocktail and my meal. Then I ordered another cocktail.
After dinner I decided to take a walk. When I returned to the hotel it
struck me a highball would be fine before going to bed, so I stepped
into the bar and had one. I remember having several more that night and
plenty next morning. I have a shadowy recollection of being in an
airplane bound for New York and of finding a friendly taxicab driver at
the landing field instead of my wife. The driver escorted me about for
several days. I know little of where I went or what I said and did. Then
came the hospital with unbearable mental and physical suffering.\"*

*\"As soon as I regained my ability to think, I went carefully over that
evening in Washington. Not only had I been off guard, I had made no
fight whatever against the first drink. This time I had not thought of
the consequences at all. I had commenced to drink as carelessly as
though the cocktails were ginger ale. I now remembered what my alcoholic
friends had told me, how they prophesied that if I had an alcoholic
mind, the time and place would come-I would drink again. They had said
that though I did raise a defense, it would one day give way before some
trivial reason for having a drink. Well, just that did happen and more,
for what I had learned of alcoholism did not occur to me at all. I knew
from that moment that I had an alcoholic mind. I saw that will power and
self-knowledge would not help in those strange mental blank spots. I had
never been able to understand people who said that a problem had them
hopelessly defeated. I knew then. It was a crushing blow.\"*

*\"Two of the members of Alcoholics Anonymous came to see me. They
grinned, which I didn't like so much, and then asked me if I thought
myself alcoholic and if I were really licked this time. I had to concede
both propositions. They piled on me heaps of evidence to the effect that
an alcoholic mentality, such as I had exhibited in Washington, was a
hopeless condition. They cited cases out of their own experience by the
dozen. This process snuffed out the last flicker of conviction that I
could do the job myself.\"*

*\"Then they outlined the spiritual answer and program of action which a
hundred of them had followed successfully. Though I had been only a
nominal churchman, their proposals were not, intellectually, hard to
swallow. But the program of action, though entirely sensible, was pretty
drastic. It meant I would have to throw several lifelong conceptions out
of the window. That was not easy. But the moment I made up my mind to go
through with the process, I had the curious feeling that my alcoholic
condition was relieved, as in fact it proved to be.*

*\"Quite as important was the discovery that spiritual principles would
solve all my problems. I have since been brought into a way of living
infinitely more satisfying and, I hope, more useful than the life I
lived before. My old manner of life was by no means a bad one, but I
would not exchange its best moments for the worst I have now. I would
not go back to it even if I could.\"*

Fred's story speaks for itself. We hope it strikes home to thousands
like him. He had felt only the first nip of the wringer. Most alcoholics
have to be pretty badly mangled before they really commence to solve
their problems.

Many doctors and psychiatrists agree with our conclusions. One of these
men, staff member of a world-renowned hospital, recently made this
statement to some of us:

*\"What you say about the general hopelessness of the average
alcoholic's plight is, in my opinion, correct. As to two of you men,
whose stories I have heard, there is no doubt in my mind that you were
100% hopeless, apart from divine help. Had you offered yourselves as
patients at this hospital, I would not have taken you, if I had been
able to avoid it. People like you are too heartbreaking. Though not a
religious person, I have profound respect for the spiritual approach in
such cases as yours. For most cases, there is virtually no other
solution.\"*

Once more: The alcoholic at certain times has no effective mental
defense against the first drink. Except in a few rare cases, neither he
nor any other human being can provide such a defense. His defense must
come from a Higher Power.

## We Agnostics

IN THE PRECEDING chapters you have learned something of alcoholism. We
hope we have made clear the distinction between the alcoholic and the
nonalcoholic. If, when you honestly want to, you find you cannot quit
entirely, or if when drinking, you have little control over the amount
you take, you are probably alcoholic. If that be the case, you may be
suffering from an illness which only a spiritual experience will
conquer.

To one who feels he is an atheist or agnostic such an experience seems
impossible, but to continue as he is means disaster, especially if he is
an alcoholic of the hopeless variety. To be doomed to an alcoholic death
or to live on a spiritual basis are not always easy alternatives to
face.

But it isn't so difficult. About half our original fellowship were of
exactly that type. At first some of us tried to avoid the issue, hoping
against hope we were not true alcoholics. But after a while we had to
face the fact that we must find a spiritual basis of life-or else.
Perhaps it is going to be that way with you. But cheer up, something
like half of us thought we were atheists or agnostics. Our experience
shows that you need not be disconcerted.

If a mere code of morals or a better philosophy of life were sufficient
to overcome alcoholism, many of us would have recovered long ago. But we
found that such codes and philosophies did not save us, no matter how
much we tried. We could wish to be moral, we could wish to be
philosophically comforted, in fact, we could will these things with all
our might, but the needed power wasn't there. Our human resources, as
marshalled by the will, were not sufficient; they failed utterly.

Lack of power, that was our dilemma. We had to find a power by which we
could live, and it had to be a Power greater than ourselves. Obviously.
But where and how were we to find this Power?

Well, that's exactly what this book is about. Its main object is to
enable you to find a Power greater than yourself which will solve your
problem. That means we have written a book which we believe to be
spiritual as well as moral. And it means, of course, that we are going
to talk about God. Here difficulty arises with agnostics. Many times we
talk to a new man and watch his hope rise as we discuss his alcoholic
problems and explain our fellowship. But his face falls when we speak of
spiritual matters, especially when we mention God, for we have re-opened
a subject which our man thought he had neatly evaded or entirely
ignored.

We know how he feels. We have shared his honest doubt and prejudice.
Some of us have been violently anti-religious. To others, the word
\"God\" brought up a particular idea of Him with which someone had tried
to impress them during childhood. Perhaps we rejected this particular
conception because it seemed inadequate. With that rejection we imagined
we had abandoned the God idea entirely. We were bothered with the
thought that faith and dependence upon a Power beyond ourselves was
somewhat weak, even cowardly. We looked upon this world of warring
individuals, warring theological systems, and inexplicable calamity,
with deep skepticism. We looked askance at many individuals who claimed
to be godly. How could a Supreme Being have anything to do with it all?
And who could comprehend a Supreme Being anyhow? Yet, in other moments,
we found ourselves thinking, when enchanted by a starlit night, \"Who,
then, made all this?\" There was a feeling of awe and wonder, but it was
fleeting and soon lost.

Yes, we of agnostic temperament have had these thoughts and experiences.
Let us make haste to reassure you. We found that as soon as we were able
to lay aside prejudice and express even a willingness to believe in a
Power greater than ourselves, we commenced to get results, even though
it was impossible for any of us to fully define or comprehend that
Power, which is God.

Much to our relief, we discovered we did not need to consider another's
conception of God. Our own conception, however inadequate, was
sufficient to make the approach and to effect a contact with Him. As
soon as we admitted the possible existence of a Creative Intelligence, a
Spirit of the Universe underlying the totality of things, we began to be
possessed of a new sense of power and direction, provided we took other
simple steps. We found that God does not make too hard terms with those
who seek Him. To us, the Realm of Spirit is broad, roomy, all inclusive;
never exclusive or forbidding to those who earnestly seek. It is open,
we believe, to all men.

When, therefore, we speak to you of God, we mean your own conception of
God. This applies, too, to other spiritual expressions which you find in
this book. Do not let any prejudice you may have against spiritual terms
deter you from honestly asking yourself what they mean to you. At the
start, this was all we needed to commence spiritual growth, to effect
our first conscious relation with God as we understood Him. Afterward,
we found ourselves accepting many things which then seemed entirely out
of reach. That was growth, but if we wished to grow we had to begin
somewhere. So we used our own conception, however limited it was.

We needed to ask ourselves but one short question. \"Do I now believe,
or am I even willing to believe, that there is a Power greater than
myself ?\" As soon as a man can say that he does believe, or is willing
to believe, we emphatically assure him that he is on his way. It has
been repeatedly proven among us that upon this simple cornerstone a
wonderfully effective spiritual structure can be built.

That was great news to us, for we had assumed we could not make use of
spiritual principles unless we accepted many things on faith which
seemed difficult to believe. When people presented us with spiritual
approaches, how frequently did we all say, \"I wish I had what that man
has. I'm sure it would work if I could only believe as he believes. But
I cannot accept as surely true the many articles of faith which are so
plain to him.\" So it was comforting to learn that we could commence at
a simpler level.

Besides a seeming inability to accept much on faith, we often found
ourselves handicapped by obstinacy, sensitiveness, and unreasoning
prejudice. Many of us have been so touchy that even casual reference to
spiritual things made us bristle with antagonism. This sort of thinking
had to be abandoned. Though some of us resisted, we found no great
difficulty in casting aside such feelings. Faced with alcoholic
destruction, we soon became as open minded on spiritual matters as we
had tried to be on other questions. In this respect alcohol was a great
persuader. It finally beat us into a state of reasonableness. Sometimes
this was a tedious process; we hope no one else will be prejudiced for
as long as some of us were.

The reader may still ask why he should believe in a Power greater than
himself. We think there are good reasons. Let us have a look at some of
them.

The practical individual of today is a stickler for facts and results.
Nevertheless, the twentieth century readily accepts theories of all
kinds, provided they are firmly grounded in fact. We have numerous
theories, for example, about electricity. Everybody believes them
without a murmur of doubt. Why this ready acceptance? Simply because it
is impossible to explain what we see, feel, direct, and use, without a
reasonable assumption as a starting point.

Everybody nowadays, believes in scores of assumptions for which there is
good evidence, but no perfect visual proof. And does not science
demonstrate that visual proof is the weakest proof? It is being
constantly revealed, as mankind studies the material world, that outward
appearances are not inward reality at all. To illustrate:

The prosaic steel girder is a mass of electrons whirling around each
other at incredible speed. These tiny bodies are governed by precise
laws, and these laws hold true throughout the material world. Science
tells us so. We have no reason to doubt it. When, however, the perfectly
logical assumption is suggested that underneath the material world and
life as we see it, there is an All Powerful, Guiding, Creative
Intelligence, right there our perverse streak comes to the surface and
we laboriously set out to convince ourselves it isn't so. We read wordy
books and indulge in windy arguments, thinking we believe this universe
needs no God to explain it. Were our contentions true, it would follow
that life originated out of nothing, means nothing, and proceeds
nowhere.

Instead of regarding ourselves as intelligent agents, spearheads of
God's ever advancing Creation, we agnostics and atheists chose to
believe that our human intelligence was the last word, the alpha and the
omega, the beginning and end of all. Rather vain of us, wasn't it?

We, who have traveled this dubious path, beg you to lay aside prejudice,
even against organized religion. We have learned that whatever the human
frailties of various faiths may be, those faiths have given purpose and
direction to millions. People of faith have a logical idea of what life
is all about. Actually, we used to have no reasonable conception
whatever. We used to amuse ourselves by cynically dissecting spiritual
beliefs and practices when we might have observed that many
spiritually-minded persons of all races, colors, and creeds were
demonstrating a degree of stability, happiness and usefulness which we
should have sought ourselves.

Instead, we looked at the human defects of these people, and sometimes
used their shortcomings as a basis of wholesale condemnation. We talked
of intolerance, while we were intolerant ourselves. We missed the
reality and the beauty of the forest because we were diverted by the
ugliness of some of its trees. We never gave the spiritual side of life
a fair hearing.

In our personal stories you will find a wide variation in the way each
teller approaches and conceives of the Power which is greater than
himself. Whether we agree with a particular approach or conception seems
to make little difference. Experience has taught us that these are
matters about which, for our purpose, we need not be worried. They are
questions for each individual to settle for himself.

On one proposition, however, these men and women are strikingly agreed.
Every one of them has gained access to, and believes in, a Power greater
than himself. This Power has in each case accomplished the miraculous,
the humanly impossible. As a celebrated American statesman put it,
\"Let's look at the record.\"

Here are thousands of men and women, worldly indeed. They flatly declare
that since they have come to believe in a Power greater than themselves,
to take a certain attitude toward that Power, and to do certain simple
things, there has been a revolutionary change in their way of living and
thinking. In the face of collapse and despair, in the face of the total
failure of their human resources, they found that a new power, peace,
happiness, and sense of direction flowed into them. This happened soon
after they wholeheartedly met a few simple requirements. Once confused
and baffled by the seeming futility of existence, they show the
underlying reasons why they were making heavy going of life. Leaving
aside the drink question, they tell why living was so unsatisfactory.
They show how the change came over them. When many hundreds of people
are able to say that the consciousness of the Presence of God is today
the most important fact of their lives, they present a powerful reason
why one should have faith.

This world of ours has made more material progress in the last century
than in all the millenniums which went before. Almost everyone knows the
reason. Students of ancient history tell us that the intellect of men in
those days was equal to the best of today. Yet in ancient times material
progress was painfully slow. The spirit of modern scientific inquiry,
research and invention was almost unknown. In the realm of the material,
men's minds were fettered by superstition, tradition, and all sorts of
fixed ideas. Some of the contemporaries of Columbus thought a round
earth preposterous. Others came near putting Galileo to death for his
astronomical heresies.

We asked ourselves this: Are not some of us just as biased and
unreasonable about the realm of the spirit as were the ancients about
the realm of the material? Even in the present century, American
newspapers were afraid to print an account of the Wright brothers' first
successful flight at Kitty Hawk. Had not all efforts at flight failed
before? Did not Professor Langley's flying machine go to the bottom of
the Potomac River? Was it not true that the best mathematical minds had
proved man could never fly? Had not people said God had reserved this
privilege to the birds? Only thirty years later the conquest of the air
was almost an old story and airplane travel was in full swing.

But in most fields our generation has witnessed complete liberation of
our thinking. Show any longshoreman a Sunday supplement describing a
proposal to explore the moon by means of a rocket and he will say \"I
bet they do it - maybe not so long either.\" Is not our age
characterized by the ease with which we discard old ideas for new, by
the complete readiness with which we throw away the theory or gadget
which does not work for something new which does?

We had to ask ourselves why we shouldn't apply to our human problems
this same readiness to change our point of view. We were having trouble
with personal relationships, we couldn't control our emotional natures,
we were a prey to misery and depression, we couldn't make a living, we
had a feeling of uselessness, we were full of fear, we were unhappy, we
couldn't seem to be of real help to other people - was not a basic
solution of these bedevilments more important than whether we should see
newsreels of lunar flight? Of course it was.

When we saw others solve their problems by a simple reliance upon the
Spirit of the Universe, we had to stop doubting the power of God. Our
ideas did not work. But the God idea did.

The Wright brothers' almost childish faith that they could build a
machine which would fly was the main-spring of their accomplishment.
Without that, nothing could have happened. We agnostics and atheists
were sticking to the idea that self-sufficiency would solve our
problems. When others showed us that \"God-sufficiency\" worked with
them, we began to feel like those who had insisted the Wrights would
never fly.

Logic is great stuff. We liked it. We still like it. It is not by chance
we were given the power to reason, to examine the evidence of our
senses, and to draw conclusions. That is one of man's magnificent
attributes. We agnostically inclined would not feel satisfied with a
proposal which does not lend itself to reasonable approach and
interpretation. Hence we are at pains to tell why we think our present
faith is reasonable, why we think it more sane and logical to believe
than not to believe, why we say our former thinking was soft and mushy
when we threw up our hands in doubt and said, \"We don't know.\"

When we became alcoholics, crushed by a self-imposed crisis we could not
postpone or evade, we had to fearlessly face the proposition that either
God is everything or else He is nothing. God either is, or He isn't.
What was our choice to be?

Arrived at this point, we were squarely confronted with the question of
faith. We couldn't duck the issue. Some of us had already walked far
over the Bridge of Reason toward the desired shore of faith. The
outlines and the promise of the New Land had brought lustre to tired
eyes and fresh courage to flagging spirits. Friendly hands had stretched
out in welcome. We were grateful that Reason had brought us so far. But
somehow, we couldn't quite step ashore. Perhaps we had been leaning too
heavily on Reason that last mile and we did not like to lose our
support.

That was natural, but let us think a little more closely. Without
knowing it, had we not been brought to where we stood by a certain kind
of faith? For did we not believe in our own reasoning? Did we not have
confidence in our ability to think? What was that but a sort of faith?
Yes, we had been faithful, abjectly faithful to the God of Reason. So,
in one way or another, we discovered that faith had been involved all
the time!

We found, too, that we had been worshippers. What a state of mental
goose-flesh that used to bring on! Had we not variously worshipped
people, sentiment, things, money, and ourselves? And then, with a better
motive, had we not worshipfully beheld the sunset, the sea, or a flower?
Who of us had not loved something or somebody? How much did these
feelings, these loves, these worships, have to do with pure reason?
Little or nothing, we saw at last. Were not these things the tissue out
of which our lives were constructed? Did not these feelings, after all,
determine the course of our existence? It was impossible to say we had
no capacity for faith, or love, or worship. In one form or another we
had been living by faith and little else.

Imagine life without faith! Were nothing left but pure reason, it
wouldn't be life. But we believed in life - of course we did. We could
not prove life in the sense that you can prove a straight line is the
shortest distance between two points, yet, there it was. Could we still
say the whole thing was nothing but a mass of electrons, created out of
nothing, meaning nothing, whirling on to a destiny of nothingness? Of
course we couldn't. The electrons themselves seemed more intelligent
than that. At least, so the chemist said.

Hence, we saw that reason isn't everything. Neither is reason, as most
of us use it, entirely dependable, though it emanate from our best
minds. What about people who proved that man could never fly?

Yet we had been seeing another kind of flight, a spiritual liberation
from this world, people who rose above their problems. They said God
made these things possible, and we only smiled. We had seen spiritual
release, but liked to tell ourselves it wasn't true.

Actually we were fooling ourselves, for deep down in every man, woman,
and child, is the fundamental idea of God. It may be obscured by
calamity, by pomp, by worship of other things, but in some form or other
it is there. For faith in a Power greater than ourselves, and miraculous
demonstrations of that power in human lives, are facts as old as man
himself.

We finally saw that faith in some kind of God was a part of our make-up,
just as much as the feeling we have for a friend. Sometimes we had to
search fearlessly, but He was there. He was as much a fact as we were.
We found the Great Reality deep down within us. In the last analysis it
is only there that He may be found. It was so with us.

We can only clear the ground a bit. If our testimony helps sweep away
prejudice, enables you to think honestly, encourages you to search
diligently within yourself, then, if you wish, you can join us on the
Broad Highway. With this attitude you cannot fail. The consciousness of
your belief is sure to come to you.

In this book you will read the experience of a man who thought he was an
atheist. His story is so interesting that some of it should be told now.
His change of heart was dramatic, convincing, and moving.

Our friend was a minister's son. He attended church school, where he
became rebellious at what he thought an overdose of religious education.
For years thereafter he was dogged by trouble and frustration. Business
failure, insanity, fatal illness, suicide - these calamities in his
immediate family embittered and depressed him. Post-war disillusionment,
ever more serious alcoholism, impending mental and physical collapse,
brought him to the point of self-destruction.

One night, when confined in a hospital, he was approached by an
alcoholic who had known a spiritual experience. Our friend's gorge rose
as he bitterly cried out: \"If there is a God, He certainly hasn't done
anything for me!\" But later, alone in his room, he asked himself this
question: \"Is it possible that all the religious people I have known
are wrong?\" While pondering the answer he felt as though he lived in
hell. Then, like a thunderbolt, a great thought came. It crowded out all
else:

\"Who are you to say there is no God?\"

This man recounts that he tumbled out of bed to his knees. In a few
seconds he was overwhelmed by a conviction of the Presence of God. It
poured over and through him with the certainty and majesty of a great
tide at flood. The barriers he had built through the years were swept
away. He stood in the Presence of Infinite Power and Love. He had
stepped from bridge to shore. For the first time, he lived in conscious
companionship with his Creator.

Thus was our friend's cornerstone fixed in place. No later vicissitude
has shaken it. His alcoholic problem was taken away. That very night,
years ago, it disappeared. Save for a few brief moments of temptation
the thought of drink has never returned; and at such times a great
revulsion has risen up in him. Seemingly he could not drink even if he
would. God had restored his sanity.

What is this but a miracle of healing? Yet its elements are simple.
Circumstances made him willing to believe. He humbly offered himself to
his Maker - then he knew.

Even so has God restored us all to our right minds. To this man, the
revelation was sudden. Some of us grow into it more slowly. But He has
come to all who have honestly sought Him.

When we drew near to Him He disclosed Himself to us!

## How It Works

RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path.
Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely
give themselves to this simple program, usually men and women who are
constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves. There are
such unfortunates. They are not at fault; they seem to have been born
that way. They are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a
manner of living which demands rigorous honesty. Their chances are less
than average. There are those, too, who suffer from grave emotional and
mental disorders, but many of them do recover if they have the capacity
to be honest.

Our stories disclose in a general way what we used to be like, what
happened, and what we are like now. If you have decided you want what we
have and are willing to go to any length to get it-then you are ready to
take certain steps.

At some of these we balked. We thought we could find an easier, softer
way. But we could not. With all the earnestness at our command, we beg
of you to be fearless and thorough from the very start. Some of us have
tried to hold on to our old ideas and the result was nil until we let go
absolutely.

Remember that we deal with alcohol - cunning, baffling, powerful!
Without help it is too much for us. But there is One who has all
power-that One is God. May you find Him now!

Half measures availed us nothing. We stood at the turning point. We
asked His protection and care with complete abandon.

Here are the steps we took, which are suggested as a program of
recovery:

1\. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had
become unmanageable. . Came to believe that a Power greater than
ourselves could restore us to sanity. . Made a decision to turn our will
and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him. . Made a
searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves. . Admitted to God,
to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.
. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.
. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings. . Made a list of all
persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all. .
Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do
so would injure them or others. . Continued to take personal inventory
and when we were wrong promptly admitted it. . Sought through prayer and
meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood
Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to
carry that out. . Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of
these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to
practice these principles in all our affairs.

Many of us exclaimed, \"What an order! I can't go through with it.\" Do
not be discouraged. No one among us has been able to maintain anything
like perfect adherence to these principles. We are not saints. The point
is, that we are willing to grow along spiritual lines. The principles we
have set down are guides to progress. We claim spiritual progress rather
than spiritual perfection.

Our description of the alcoholic, the chapter to the agnostic, and our
personal adventures before and after make clear three pertinent ideas:

\(a\) That we were alcoholic and could not manage our own lives. (b)
That probably no human power could have relieved our alcoholism. (c)
That God could and would if He were sought.

Being convinced, we were at Step Three, which is that we decided to turn
our will and our life over to God as we understood Him. Just what do we
mean by that, and just what do we do?

The first requirement is that we be convinced that any life run on
self-will can hardly be a success. On that basis we are almost always in
collision with something or somebody, even though our motives are good.
Most people try to live by self-propulsion. Each person is like an actor
who wants to run the whole show; is forever trying to arrange the
lights, the ballet, the scenery and the rest of the players in his own
way. If his arrangements would only stay put, if only people would do as
he wished, the show would be great. Everybody, including himself, would
be pleased. Life would be wonderful. In trying to make these
arrangements our actor may sometimes be quite virtuous. He may be kind,
considerate, patient, generous; even modest and self-sacrificing. On the
other hand, he may be mean, egotistical, selfish and dishonest. But, as
with most humans, he is more likely to have varied traits.

What usually happens? The show doesn't come off very well. He begins to
think life doesn't treat him right. He decides to exert himself more. He
becomes, on the next occasion, still more demanding or gracious, as the
case may be. Still the play does not suit him. Admitting he may be
somewhat at fault, he is sure that other people are more to blame. He
becomes angry, indignant, self-pitying. What is his basic trouble? Is he
not really a self-seeker even when trying to be kind? Is he not a victim
of the delusion that he can wrest satisfaction and happiness out of this
world if he only manages well? Is it not evident to all the rest of the
players that these are the things he wants? And do not his actions make
each of them wish to retaliate, snatching all they can get out of the
show? Is he not, even in his best moments, a producer of confusion
rather than harmony?

Our actor is self-centered-ego-centric, as people like to call it
nowadays. He is like the retired business man who lolls in the Florida
sunshine in the winter complaining of the sad state of the nation; the
minister who sighs over the sins of the twentieth century; politicians
and reformers who are sure all would be Utopia if the rest of the world
would only behave; the outlaw safe cracker who thinks society has
wronged him; and the alcoholic who has lost all and is locked up.
Whatever our protestations, are not most of us concerned with ourselves,
our resentments, or our self-pity?

Selfishness-self-centeredness! That, we think, is the root of our
troubles. Driven by a hundred forms of fear, self-delusion,
self-seeking, and self-pity, we step on the toes of our fellows and they
retaliate. Sometimes they hurt us, seemingly without provocation, but we
invariably find that at some time in the past we have made decisions
based on self which later placed us in a position to be hurt.

So our troubles, we think, are basically of our own making. They arise
out of ourselves, and the alcoholic is an extreme example of self-will
run riot, though he usually doesn't think so. Above everything, we
alcoholics must be rid of this selfishness. We must, or it kills us! God
makes that possible. And there often seems no way of entirely getting
rid of self without His aid. Many of us had moral and philosophical
convictions galore, but we could not live up to them even though we
would have liked to. Neither could we reduce our self-centeredness much
by wishing or trying on our own power. We had to have God's help.

This is the how and why of it. First of all, we had to quit playing God.
It didn't work. Next, we decided that hereafter in this drama of life,
God was going to be our Director. He is the Principal; we are His
agents. He is the Father, and we are His children. Most good ideas are
simple, and this concept was the keystone of the new and triumphant arch
through which we passed to freedom.

When we sincerely took such a position, all sorts of remarkable things
followed. We had a new Employer. Being all powerful, He provided what we
needed, if we kept close to Him and performed His work well. Established
on such a footing we became less and less interested in ourselves, our
little plans and designs. More and more we became interested in seeing
what we could contribute to life. As we felt new power flow in, as we
enjoyed peace of mind, as we discovered we could face life successfully,
as we became conscious of His presence, we began to lose our fear of
today, tomorrow or the hereafter. We were reborn.

We were now at Step Three. Many of us said to our Maker, as we
understood Him: \"God, I offer myself to Thee-to build with me and to do
with me as Thou wilt. Relieve me of the bondage of self, that I may
better do Thy will. Take away my difficulties, that victory over them
may bear witness to those I would help of Thy Power, Thy Love, and Thy
Way of life. May I do Thy will always!\" We thought well before taking
this step making sure we were ready; that we could at last abandon
ourselves utterly to Him.

We found it very desirable to take this spiritual step with an
understanding person, such as our wife, best friend or spiritual
adviser. But it is better to meet God alone than with one who might
misunderstand. The wording was, of course, quite optional so long as we
expressed the idea, voicing it without reservation. This was only a
beginning, though if honestly and humbly made, an effect, sometimes a
very great one, was felt at once.

Next we launched out on a course of vigorous action, the first step of
which is a personal housecleaning, which many of us had never attempted.
Though our decision was a vital and crucial step, it could have little
permanent effect unless at once followed by a strenuous effort to face,
and to be rid of, the things in ourselves which had been blocking us.
Our liquor was but a symptom. So we had to get down to causes and
conditions.

Therefore, we started upon a personal inventory. This was Step Four. A
business which takes no regular inventory usually goes broke. Taking a
commercial inventory is a fact-finding and a fact-facing process. It is
an effort to discover the truth about the stock-in-trade. One object is
to disclose damaged or unsalable goods, to get rid of them promptly and
without regret. If the owner of the business is to be successful, he
cannot fool himself about values.

We did exactly the same thing with our lives. We took stock honestly.
First, we searched out the flaws in our make-up which caused our
failure. Being convinced that self, manifested in various ways, was what
had defeated us, we considered its common manifestations.

Resentment is the \"number one\" offender. It destroys more alcoholics
than anything else. From it stem all forms of spiritual disease, for we
have been not only mentally and physically ill, we have been spiritually
sick. When the spiritual malady is overcome, we straighten out mentally
and physically. In dealing with resentments, we set them on paper. We
listed people, institutions or principles with whom we were angry. We
asked ourselves why we were angry. In most cases it was found that our
self-esteem, our pocketbooks, our ambitions, our personal relationships
(including sex) were hurt or threatened. So we were sore. We were
\"burned up.\"

On our grudge list we set opposite each name our injuries. Was it our
self-esteem, our security, our ambitions, our personal, or sex
relations, which had been interfered with?

We were usually as definite as this example:

I'm resentful at: The Cause Affects my:

Mr. Brown His attention to my Sex relations. wife. Self-esteem (fear)
Told my wife of my Sex relations. mistress. Self-esteem (fear) Brown may
get my Security. job at the office. Self-esteem (fear) Mrs. Jones She's
a nut - she Personal relationship. snubbed me. She Self-esteem (fear)
committed her husband for drinking. He's my friend. She's a gossip. My
employer Unreasonable - Unjust Self-esteem(fear) - Overbearing -
Security. Threatens to fire me for drinking and padding my expense
account. My wife Misunderstands and Pride - Personal nags. Likes Brown.
sex relations - Wants house put in Security (fear) her name.

We went back through our lives. Nothing counted but thoroughness and
honesty. When we were finished we considered it carefully. The first
thing apparent was that this world and its people were often quite
wrong. To conclude that others were wrong was as far as most of us ever
got. The usual outcome was that people continued to wrong us and we
stayed sore. Sometimes it was remorse and then we were sore at
ourselves. But the more we fought and tried to have our own way, the
worse matters got. As in war, the victor only seemed to win. Our moments
of triumph were short-lived.

It is plain that a life which includes deep resentment leads only to
futility and unhappiness. To the precise extent that we permit these, do
we squander the hours that might have been worth while. But with the
alcoholic, whose hope is the maintenance and growth of a spiritual
experience, this business of resentment is infinitely grave. We found
that it is fatal. For when harboring such feelings we shut ourselves off
from the sunlight of the Spirit. The insanity of alcohol returns and we
drink again. And with us, to drink is to die.

If we were to live, we had to be free of anger. The grouch and the
brainstorm were not for us. They may be the dubious luxury of normal
men, but for alcoholics these things are poison.

We turned back to the list, for it held the key to the future. We were
prepared to look at it from an entirely different angle. We began to see
that the world and its people really dominated us. In that state, the
wrong-doing of others, fancied or real, had power to actually kill. How
could we escape? We saw that these resentments must be mastered, but
how? We could not wish them away any more than alcohol.

This was our course: We realized that the people who wronged us were
perhaps spiritually sick. Though we did not like their symptoms and the
way these disturbed us, they, like ourselves, were sick too. We asked
God to help us show them the same tolerance, pity, and patience that we
would cheerfully grant a sick friend. When a person offended we said to
ourselves, \"This is a sick man. How can I be helpful to him? God save
me from being angry. Thy will be done.\"

We avoid retaliation or argument. We wouldn't treat sick people that
way. If we do, we destroy our chance of being helpful. We cannot be
helpful to all people, but at least God will show us how to take a
kindly and tolerant view of each and every one.

Referring to our list again. Putting out of our minds the wrongs others
had done, we resolutely looked for our own mistakes. Where had we been
selfish, dishonest, self-seeking and frightened? Though a situation had
not been entirely our fault, we tried to disregard the other person
involved entirely. Where were we to blame? The inventory was ours, not
the other man's. When we saw our faults we listed them. We placed them
before us in black and white. We admitted our wrongs honestly and were
willing to set these matters straight.

Notice that the word \"fear\" is bracketed alongside the difficulties
with Mr. Brown, Mrs. Jones, the employer, and the wife. This short word
somehow touches about every aspect of our lives. It was an evil and
corroding thread; the fabric of our existence was shot through with it.
It set in motion trains of circumstances which brought us misfortune we
felt we didn't deserve. But did not we, ourselves, set the ball rolling?
Sometimes we think fear ought to be classed with stealing. It seems to
cause more trouble.

We reviewed our fears thoroughly. We put them on paper, even though we
had no resentment in connection with them. We asked ourselves why we had
them. Wasn't it because self-reliance failed us? Self-reliance was good
as far as it went, but it didn't go far enough. Some of us once had
great self-confidence, but it didn't fully solve the fear problem, or
any other. When it made us cocky, it was worse.

Perhaps there is a better way-we think so. For we are now on a different
basis; the basis of trusting and relying upon God. We trust infinite God
rather than our finite selves. We are in the world to play the role He
assigns. Just to the extent that we do as we think He would have us, and
humbly rely on Him, does He enable us to match calamity with serenity.

We never apologize to anyone for depending upon our Creator. We can
laugh at those who think spirituality the way of weakness.
Paradoxically, it is the way of strength. The verdict of the ages is
that faith means courage. All men of faith have courage. They trust
their God. We never apologize for God. Instead we let Him demonstrate,
through us, what He can do. We ask Him to remove our fear and direct our
attention to what He would have us be. At once, we commence to outgrow
fear.

Now about sex. Many of us needed an overhauling there. But above all, we
tried to be sensible on this question. It's so easy to get way off the
track. Here we find human opinions running to extremes-absurd extremes,
perhaps. One set of voices cry that sex is a lust of our lower nature, a
base necessity of procreation. Then we have the voices who cry for sex
and more sex; who bewail the institution of marriage; who think that
most of the troubles of the race are traceable to sex causes. They think
we do not have enough of it, or that it isn't the right kind. They see
its significance everywhere. One school would allow man no flavor for
his fare and the other would have us all on a straight pepper diet. We
want to stay out of this controversy. We do not want to be the arbiter
of anyone's sex conduct. We all have sex problems. We'd hardly be human
if we didn't. What can we do about them?

We reviewed our own conduct over the years past. Where had we been
selfish, dishonest, or inconsiderate? Whom had we hurt? Did we
unjustifiably arouse jealousy, suspicion or bitterness? Where were we at
fault, what should we have done instead? We got this all down on paper
and looked at it.

In this way we tried to shape a sane and sound ideal for our future sex
life. We subjected each relation to this test-was it selfish or not? We
asked God to mold our ideals and help us to live up to them. We
remembered always that our sex powers were God-given and therefore good,
neither to be used lightly or selfishly nor to be despised and loathed.

Whatever our ideal turns out to be, we must be willing to grow toward
it. We must be willing to make amends where we have done harm, provided
that we do not bring about still more harm in so doing. In other words,
we treat sex as we would any other problem. In meditation, we ask God
what we should do about each specific matter. The right answer will
come, if we want it.

God alone can judge our sex situation. Counsel with persons is often
desirable, but we let God be the final judge. We realize that some
people are as fanatical about sex as others are loose. We avoid
hysterical thinking or advice.

Suppose we fall short of the chosen ideal and stumble? Does this mean we
are going to get drunk? Some people tell us so. But this is only a
half-truth. It depends on us and on our motives. If we are sorry for
what we have done, and have the honest desire to let God take us to
better things, we believe we will be forgiven and will have learned our
lesson. If we are not sorry, and our conduct continues to harm others,
we are quite sure to drink. We are not theorizing. These are facts out
of our experience.

To sum up about sex: We earnestly pray for the right ideal, for guidance
in each questionable situation, for sanity, and for the strength to do
the right thing. If sex is very troublesome, we throw ourselves the
harder into helping others. We think of their needs and work for them.
This takes us out of ourselves. It quiets the imperious urge, when to
yield would mean heartache.

If we have been thorough about our personal inventory, we have written
down a lot. We have listed and analyzed our resentments. We have begun
to comprehend their futility and their fatality. We have commenced to
see their terrible destructiveness. We have begun to learn tolerance,
patience and good will toward all men, even our enemies, for we look on
them as sick people. We have listed the people we have hurt by our
conduct, and are willing to straighten out the past if we can.

In this book you read again and again that faith did for us what we
could not do for ourselves. We hope you are convinced now that God can
remove whatever self-will has blocked you off from Him. If you have
already made a decision, and an inventory of your grosser handicaps, you
have made a good beginning. That being so you have swallowed and
digested some big chunks of truth about yourself.

## Into Action

HAVING MADE our personal inventory, what shall we do about it? We have
been trying to get a new attitude, a new relationship with our Creator,
and to discover the obstacles in our path. We have admitted certain
defects; we have ascertained in a rough way what the trouble is; we have
put our finger on the weak items in our personal inventory. Now these
are about to be cast out. This requires action on our part, which, when
completed, will mean that we have admitted to God, to ourselves, and to
another human being, the exact nature of our defects. This brings us to
the Fifth Step in the program of recovery mentioned in the preceding
chapter.

This is perhaps difficult-especially discussing our defects with another
person. We think we have done well enough in admitting these things to
ourselves. There is doubt about that. In actual practice, we usually
find a solitary self-appraisal insufficient. Many of us thought it
necessary to go much further. We will be more reconciled to discussing
ourselves with another person when we see good reasons why we should do
so. The best reason first: If we skip this vital step, we may not
overcome drinking. Time after time newcomers have tried to keep to
themselves certain facts about their lives. Trying to avoid this
humbling experience, they have turned to easier methods. Almost
invariably they got drunk. Having persevered with the rest of the
program, they wondered why they fell. We think the reason is that they
never completed their housecleaning. They took inventory all right, but
hung on to some of the worst items in stock. They only thought they had
lost their egoism and fear; they only thought they had humbled
themselves. But they had not learned enough of humility, fearlessness
and honesty, in the sense we find it necessary, until they told someone
else all their life story.

More than most people, the alcoholic leads a double life. He is very
much the actor. To the outer world he presents his stage character. This
is the one he likes his fellows to see. He wants to enjoy a certain
reputation, but knows in his heart he doesn't deserve it.

The inconsistency is made worse by the things he does on his sprees.
Coming to his senses, he is revolted at certain episodes he vaguely
remembers. These memories are a nightmare. He trembles to think someone
might have observed him. As fast as he can, he pushes these memories far
inside himself. He hopes they will never see the light of day. He is
under constant fear and tension-that makes for more drinking.

Psychologists are inclined to agree with us. We have spent thousands of
dollars for examinations. We know but few instances where we have given
these doctors a fair break. We have seldom told them the whole truth nor
have we followed their advice. Unwilling to be honest with these
sympathetic men, we were honest with no one else. Small wonder many in
the medical profession have a low opinion of alcoholics and their chance
for recovery!

We must be entirely honest with somebody if we expect to live long or
happily in this world. Rightly and naturally, we think well before we
choose the person or persons with whom to take this intimate and
confidential step. Those of us belonging to a religious denomination
which requires confession must, and of course, will want to go to the
properly appointed authority whose duty it is to receive it. Though we
have no religious connection, we may still do well to talk with someone
ordained by an established religion. We often find such a person quick
to see and understand our problem. Of course, we sometimes encounter
people who do not understand alcoholics.

If we cannot or would rather not do this, we search our acquaintance for
a close-mouthed, understanding friend. Perhaps our doctor or
psychologist will be the person. It may be one of our own family, but we
cannot disclose anything to our wives or our parents which will hurt
them and make them unhappy. We have no right to save our own skin at
another person's expense. Such parts of our story we tell to someone who
will understand, yet be unaffected. The rule is we must be hard on
ourself, but always considerate of others.

Notwithstanding the great necessity for discussing ourselves with
someone, it may be one is so situated that there is no suitable person
available. If that is so, this step may be postponed, only, however, if
we hold ourselves in complete readiness to go through with it at the
first opportunity. We say this because we are very anxious that we talk
to the right person. It is important that he be able to keep a
confidence; that he fully understand and approve what we are driving at;
that he will not try to change our plan. But we must not use this as a
mere excuse to postpone.

When we decide who is to hear our story, we waste no time. We have a
written inventory and we are prepared for a long talk. We explain to our
partner what we are about to do and why we have to do it. He should
realize that we are engaged upon a life-and-death errand. Most people
approached in this way will be glad to help; they will be honored by our
confidence.

We pocket our pride and go to it, illuminating every twist of character,
every dark cranny of the past. Once we have taken this step, withholding
nothing, we are delighted. We can look the world in the eye. We can be
alone at perfect peace and ease. Our fears fall from us. We begin to
feel the nearness of our Creator. We may have had certain spiritual
beliefs, but now we begin to have a spiritual experience. The feeling
that the drink problem has disappeared will often come strongly. We feel
we are on the Broad Highway, walking hand in hand with the Spirit of the
Universe.

Returning home we find a place where we can be quiet for an hour,
carefully reviewing what we have done. We thank God from the bottom of
our heart that we know Him better. Taking this book down from our shelf
we turn to the page which contains the twelve steps. Carefully reading
the first five proposals we ask if we have omitted anything, for we are
building an arch through which we shall walk a free man at last. Is our
work solid so far? Are the stones properly in place? Have we skimped on
the cement put into the foundation? Have we tried to make mortar without
sand?

If we can answer to our satisfaction, we then look at Step Six. We have
emphasized willingness as being indispensable. Are we now ready to let
God remove from us all the things which we have admitted are
objectionable? Can He now take them all-every one? If we still cling to
something we will not let go, we ask God to help us be willing.

When ready, we say something like this: \"My Creator, I am now willing
that you should have all of me, good and bad. I pray that you now remove
from me every single defect of character which stands in the way of my
usefulness to you and my fellows. Grant me strength, as I go out from
here, to do your bidding. Amen.\" We have then completed Step Seven.

Now we need more action, without which we find that \"Faith without
works is dead.\" Let's look at Steps Eight and Nine. We have a list of
all persons we have harmed and to whom we are willing to make amends. We
made it when we took inventory. We subjected ourselves to a drastic
self-appraisal. Now we go out to our fellows and repair the damage done
in the past. We attempt to sweep away the debris which has accumulated
out of our effort to live on self-will and run the show ourselves. If we
haven't the will to do this, we ask until it comes. Remember it was
agreed at the beginning we would go to any lengths for victory over
alcohol.

Probably there are still some misgivings. As we look over the list of
business acquaintances and friends we have hurt, we may feel diffident
about going to some of them on a spiritual basis. Let us be reassured.
To some people we need not, and probably should not emphasize the
spiritual feature on our first approach. We might prejudice them. At the
moment we are trying to put our lives in order. But this is not an end
in itself. Our real purpose is to fit ourselves to be of maximum service
to God and the people about us. It is seldom wise to approach an
individual, who still smarts from our injustice to him, and announce
that we have gone religious. In the prize ring, this would be called
leading with the chin. Why lay ourselves open to being branded fanatics
or religious bores? We may kill a future opportunity to carry a
beneficial message. But our man is sure to be impressed with a sincere
desire to set right the wrong. He is going to be more interested in a
demonstration of good will than in our talk of spiritual discoveries.

We don't use this as an excuse for shying away from the subject of God.
When it will serve any good purpose, we are willing to announce our
convictions with tact and common sense. The question of how to approach
the man we hated will arise. It may be he has done us more harm than we
have done him and, though we may have acquired a better attitude toward
him, we are still not too keen about admitting our faults. Nevertheless,
with a person we dislike, we take the bit in our teeth. It is harder to
go to an enemy than to a friend, but we find it much more beneficial to
us. We go to him in a helpful and forgiving spirit, confessing our
former ill feeling and expressing our regret.

Under no condition do we criticize such a person or argue. Simply we
tell him that we will never get over drinking until we have done our
utmost to straighten out the past. We are there to sweep off our side of
the street, realizing that nothing worth while can be accomplished until
we do so, never trying to tell him what he should do. His faults are not
discussed. We stick to our own. If our manner is calm, frank, and open,
we will be gratified with the result.

In nine cases out of ten the unexpected happens. Sometimes the man we
are calling upon admits his own fault, so feuds of years' standing melt
away in an hour. Rarely do we fail to make satisfactory progress. Our
former enemies sometimes praise what we are doing and wish us well.
Occasionally, they will offer assistance. It should not matter, however,
if someone does throw us out of his office. We have made our
demonstration, done our part. It's water over the dam.

Most alcoholics owe money. We do not dodge our creditors. Telling them
what we are trying to do, we make no bones about our drinking; they
usually know it anyway, whether we think so or not. Nor are we afraid of
disclosing our alcoholism on the theory it may cause financial harm.
Approached in this way, the most ruthless creditor will sometimes
surprise us. Arranging the best deal we can we let these people know we
are sorry. Our drinking has made us slow to pay. We must lose our fear
of creditors no matter how far we have to go, for we are liable to drink
if we are afraid to face them.

Perhaps we have committed a criminal offense which might land us in jail
if it were known to the authorities. We may be short in our accounts and
unable to make good. We have already admitted this in confidence to
another person, but we are sure we would be imprisoned or lose our job
if it were known. Maybe it's only a petty offense such as padding the
expense account. Most of us have done that sort of thing. Maybe we are
divorced, and have remarried but haven't kept up the alimony to number
one. She is indignant about it, and has a warrant out for our arrest.
That's a common form of trouble too.

Although these reparations take innumerable forms, there are some
general principles which we find guiding. Reminding ourselves that we
have decided to go to any lengths to find a spiritual experience, we ask
that we be given strength and direction to do the right thing, no matter
what the personal consequences may be. We may lose our position or
reputation or face jail, but we are willing. We have to be. We must not
shrink at anything.

Usually, however, other people are involved. Therefore, we are not to be
the hasty and foolish martyr who would needlessly sacrifice others to
save himself from the alcoholic pit. A man we know had remarried.
Because of resentment and drinking, he had not paid alimony to his first
wife. She was furious. She went to court and got an order for his
arrest. He had commenced our way of life, had secured a position, and
was getting his head above water. It would have been impressive heroics
if he had walked up to the Judge and said, \"Here I am.\"

We thought he ought to be willing to do that if necessary, but if he
were in jail he could provide nothing for either family. We suggested he
write his first wife admitting his faults and asking forgiveness. He
did, and also sent a small amount of money. He told her what he would
try to do in the future. He said he was perfectly willing to go to jail
if she insisted. Of course she did not, and the whole situation has long
since been adjusted.

Before taking drastic action which might implicate other people we
secure their consent. If we have obtained permission, have consulted
with others, asked God to help and the drastic step is indicated we must
not shrink.

This brings to mind a story about one of our friends. While drinking, he
accepted a sum of money from a bitterly-hated business rival, giving him
no receipt for it. He subsequently denied having received the money and
used the incident as a basis for discrediting the man. He thus used his
own wrong-doing as a means of destroying the reputation of another. In
fact, his rival was ruined.

He felt that he had done a wrong he could not possibly make right. If he
opened that old affair, he was afraid it would destroy the reputation of
his partner, disgrace his family and take away his means of livelihood.
What right had he to involve those dependent upon him? How could he
possibly make a public statement exonerating his rival?

After consulting with his wife and partner he came to the conclusion
that is was better to take those risks than to stand before his Creator
guilty of such ruinous slander. He saw that he had to place the outcome
in God's hands or he would soon start drinking again, and all would be
lost anyhow. He attended church for the first time in many years. After
the sermon, he quietly got up and made an explanation. His action met
wide-spread approval, and today he is one of the most trusted citizens
of his town. This all happened years ago.

The chances are that we have domestic troubles. Perhaps we are mixed up
with women in a fashion we wouldn't care to have advertised. We doubt
if, in this respect, alcoholics are fundamentally much worse than other
people. But drinking does complicate sex relations in the home. After a
few years with an alcoholic, a wife gets worn out, resentful and
uncommunicative. How could she be anything else? The husband begins to
feel lonely, sorry for himself. He commences to look around in the night
clubs, or their equivalent, for something besides liquor. Perhaps he is
having a secret and exciting affair with \"the girl who understands.\"
In fairness we must say that she may understand, but what are we going
to do about a thing like that? A man so involved often feels very
remorseful at times, especially if he is married to a loyal and
courageous girl who has literally gone through hell for him.

Whatever the situation, we usually have to do something about it. If we
are sure our wife does not know, should we tell her? Not always, we
think. If she knows in a general way that we have been wild, should we
tell her in detail? Undoubtedly we should admit our fault. She may
insist on knowing all the particulars. She will want to know who the
woman is and where she is. We feel we ought to say to her that we have
no right to involve another person. We are sorry for what we have done
and, God willing, it shall not be repeated. More than that we cannot do;
we have no right to go further. Though there may be justifiable
exceptions, and though we wish to lay down no rule of any sort, we have
often found this the best course to take.

Our design for living is not a one-way street. It is as good for the
wife as for the husband. If we can forget, so can she. It is better,
however, that one does not needlessly name a person upon whom she can
vent jealousy.

Perhaps there are some cases where the utmost frankness is demanded. No
outsider can appraise such an intimate situation. It may be that both
will decide that the way of good sense and loving kindness is to let
by-gones be by-gones. Each might pray about it, having the other one's
happiness uppermost in mind. Keep it always in sight that we are dealing
with that most terrible human emotion-jealousy. Good generalship may
decide that the problem be attacked on the flank rather than risk a
face-to-face combat.

If we have no such complication, there is plenty we should do at home.
Sometimes we hear an alcoholic say that the only thing he needs to do is
to keep sober. Certainly he must keep sober, for there will be no home
if he doesn't. But he is yet a long way from making good to the wife or
parents whom for years he has so shockingly treated. Passing all
understanding is the patience mothers and wives have had with
alcoholics. Had this not been so, many of us would have no homes today,
would perhaps be dead.

The alcoholic is like a tornado roaring his way through the lives of
others. Hearts are broken. Sweet relationships are dead. Affections have
been uprooted. Selfish and inconsiderate habits have kept the home in
turmoil. We feel a man is unthinking when he says that sobriety is
enough. He is like the farmer who came up out of his cyclone cellar to
find his home ruined. To his wife, he remarked, \"Don't see anything the
matter here, Ma. Ain't it grand the wind stopped blowin'?\"

Yes, there is a long period of reconstruction ahead. We must take the
lead. A remorseful mumbling that we are sorry won't fill the bill at
all. We ought to sit down with the family and frankly analyze the past
as we now see it, being very careful not to criticize them. Their
defects may be glaring, but the chances are that our own actions are
partly responsible. So we clean house with the family, asking each
morning in meditation that our Creator show us the way of patience,
tolerance, kindliness and love.

The spiritual life is not a theory. We have to live it. Unless one's
family expresses a desire to live upon spiritual principles we think we
ought not to urge them. We should not talk incessantly to them about
spiritual matters. They will change in time. Our behavior will convince
them more than our words. We must remember that ten or twenty years of
drunkenness would make a skeptic out of anyone.

There may be some wrongs we can never fully right. We don't worry about
them if we can honestly say to ourselves that we would right them if we
could. Some people cannot be seen-we send them an honest letter. And
there may be a valid reason for postponement in some cases. But we don't
delay if it can be avoided. We should be sensible, tactful, considerate
and humble without being servile or scraping. As God's people we stand
on our feet; we don't crawl before anyone.

If we are painstaking about this phase of our development, we will be
amazed before we are half way through. We are going to know a new
freedom and a new happiness. We will not regret the past nor wish to
shut the door on it. We will comprehend the word serenity and we will
know peace. No matter how far down the scale we have gone, we will see
how our experience can benefit others. That feeling of uselessness and
self-pity will disappear. We will lose interest in selfish things and
gain interest in our fellows. Self-seeking will slip away. Our whole
attitude and outlook upon life will change. Fear of people and of
economic insecurity will leave us. We will intuitively know how to
handle situations which used to baffle us. We will suddenly realize that
God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.

Are these extravagant promises? We think not. They are being fulfilled
among us-sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly. They will always
materialize if we work for them.

This thought brings us to Step Ten, which suggests we continue to take
personal inventory and continue to set right any new mistakes as we go
along. We vigorously commenced this way of living as we cleaned up the
past. We have entered the world of the Spirit. Our next function is to
grow in understanding and effectiveness. This is not an overnight
matter. It should continue for our lifetime. Continue to watch for
selfishness, dishonesty, resentment, and fear. When these crop up, we
ask God at once to remove them. We discuss them with someone immediately
and make amends quickly if we have harmed anyone. Then we resolutely
turn our thoughts to someone we can help. Love and tolerance of others
is our code.

And we have ceased fighting anything or anyone-even alcohol. For by this
time sanity will have returned. We will seldom be interested in liquor.
If tempted, we recoil from it as from a hot flame. We react sanely and
normally, and we will find that this has happened automatically. We will
see that our new attitude toward liquor has been given us without any
thought or effort on our part. It just comes! That is the miracle of it.
We are not fighting it, neither are we avoiding temptation. We feel as
though we had been placed in a position of neutrality-safe and
protected. We have not even sworn off. Instead, the problem has been
removed. It does not exist for us. We are neither cocky nor are we
afraid. That is our experience. That is how we react so long as we keep
in fit spiritual condition.

It is easy to let up on the spiritual program of action and rest on our
laurels. We are headed for trouble if we do, for alcohol is a subtle
foe. We are not cured of alcoholism. What we really have is a daily
reprieve contingent on the maintenance of our spiritual condition. Every
day is a day when we must carry the vision of God's will into all of our
activities. \"How can I best serve Thee-Thy will (not mine) be done.\"
These are thoughts which must go with us constantly. We can exercise our
will power along this line all we wish. It is the proper use of the
will.

Much has already been said about receiving strength, inspiration, and
direction from Him who has all knowledge and power. If we have carefully
followed directions, we have begun to sense the flow of His Spirit into
us. To some extent we have become God-conscious. We have begun to
develop this vital sixth sense. But we must go further and that means
more action.

Step Eleven suggests prayer and meditation. We shouldn't be shy on this
matter of prayer. Better men than we are using it constantly. It works,
if we have the proper attitude and work at it. It would be easy to be
vague about this matter. Yet, we believe we can make some definite and
valuable suggestions.

When we retire at night, we constructively review our day. Were we
resentful, selfish, dishonest or afraid? Do we owe an apology? Have we
kept something to ourselves which should be discussed with another
person at once? Were we kind and loving toward all? What could we have
done better? Were we thinking of ourselves most of the time? Or were we
thinking of what we could do for others, of what we could pack into the
stream of life? But we must be careful not to drift into worry, remorse
or morbid reflection, for that would diminish our usefulness to others.
After making our review we ask God's forgiveness and inquire what
corrective measures should be taken.

On awakening let us think about the twenty-four hours ahead. We consider
our plans for the day. Before we begin, we ask God to direct our
thinking, especially asking that it be divorced from self-pity,
dishonest or self-seeking motives. Under these conditions we can employ
our mental faculties with assurance, for after all God gave us brains to
use. Our thought-life will be placed on a much higher plane when our
thinking is cleared of wrong motives.

In thinking about our day we may face indecision. We may not be able to
determine which course to take. Here we ask God for inspiration, an
intuitive thought or a decision. We relax and take it easy. We don't
struggle. We are often surprised how the right answers come after we
have tried this for a while. What used to be the hunch or the occasional
inspiration gradually becomes a working part of the mind. Being still
inexperienced and having just made conscious contact with God, it is not
probable that we are going to be inspired at all times. We might pay for
this presumption in all sorts of absurd actions and ideas. Nevertheless,
we find that our thinking will, as time passes, be more and more on the
plane of inspiration. We come to rely upon it.

We usually conclude the period of meditation with a prayer that we be
shown all through the day what our next step is to be, that we be given
whatever we need to take care of such problems. We ask especially for
freedom from self-will, and are careful to make no request for ourselves
only. We may ask for ourselves, however, if others will be helped. We
are careful never to pray for our own selfish ends. Many of us have
wasted a lot of time doing that and it doesn't work. You can easily see
why.

If circumstances warrant, we ask our wives or friends to join us in
morning meditation. If we belong to a religious denomination which
requires a definite morning devotion, we attend to that also. If not
members of religious bodies, we sometimes select and memorize a few set
prayers which emphasize the principles we have been discussing. There
are many helpful books also. Suggestions about these may be obtained
from one's priest, minister, or rabbi. Be quick to see where religious
people are right. Make use of what they offer.

As we go through the day we pause, when agitated or doubtful, and ask
for the right thought or action. We constantly remind ourselves we are
no longer running the show, humbly saying to ourselves many times each
day \"Thy will be done.\" We are then in much less danger of excitement,
fear, anger, worry, self-pity, or foolish decisions. We become much more
efficient. We do not tire so easily, for we are not burning up energy
foolishly as we did when we were trying to arrange life to suit
ourselves.

It works-it really does.

We alcoholics are undisciplined. So we let God discipline us in the
simple way we have just outlined.

But this is not all. There is action and more action. \"Faith without
works is dead.\" The next chapter is entirely devoted to Step Twelve.

## Working With Others

PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE shows that nothing will so much insure immunity
from drinking as intensive work with other alcoholics. It works when
other activities fail. This is our twelfth suggestion: Carry this
message to other alcoholics! You can help when no one else can. You can
secure their confidence when others fail. Remember they are very ill.

Life will take on new meaning. To watch people recover, to see them help
others, to watch loneliness vanish, to see a fellowship grow up about
you, to have a host of friends-this is an experience you must not miss.
We know you will not want to miss it. Frequent contact with newcomers
and with each other is the bright spot of our lives.

Perhaps you are not acquainted with any drinkers who want to recover.
You can easily find some by asking a few doctors, ministers, priests or
hospitals. They will be only too glad to assist you. Don't start out as
an evangelist or reformer. Unfortunately a lot of prejudice exists. You
will be handicapped if you arouse it. Ministers and doctors are
competent and you can learn much from them if you wish, but it happens
that because of your own drinking experience you can be uniquely useful
to other alcoholics. So cooperate; never criticize. To be helpful is our
only aim.

When you discover a prospect for Alcoholics Anonymous, find out all you
can about him. If he does not want to stop drinking, don't waste time
trying to persuade him. You may spoil a later opportunity. This advice
is given for his family also. They should be patient, realizing they are
dealing with a sick person.

If there is any indication that he wants to stop, have a good talk with
the person most interested in him-usually his wife. Get an idea of his
behavior, his problems, his background, the seriousness of his
condition, and his religious leanings. You need this information to put
yourself in his place, to see how you would like him to approach you if
the tables were turned.

Sometimes it is wise to wait till he goes on a binge. The family may
object to this, but unless he is in a dangerous physical condition, it
is better to risk it. Don't deal with him when he is very drunk, unless
he is ugly and the family needs your help. Wait for the end of the
spree, or at least for a lucid interval. Then let his family or a friend
ask him if he wants to quit for good and if he would go to any extreme
to do so. If he says yes, then his attention should be drawn to you as a
person who has recovered. You should be described to him as one of a
fellowship who, as part of their own recovery, try to help others and
who will be glad to talk to him if he cares to see you.

If he does not want to see you, never force yourself upon him. Neither
should the family hysterically plead with him to do anything, nor should
they tell him much about you. They should wait for the end of his next
drinking bout. You might place this book where he can see it in the
interval. Here no specific rule can be given. The family must decide
these things. But urge them not to be over-anxious, for that might spoil
matters.

Usually the family should not try to tell your story. When possible,
avoid meeting a man through his family. Approach through a doctor or an
institution is a better bet. If your man needs hospitalization, he
should have it, but not forcibly unless he is violent. Let the doctor,
if he will, tell him he has something in the way of a solution.

When your man is better, the doctor might suggest a visit from you.
Though you have talked with the family, leave them out of the first
discussion. Under these conditions your prospect will see he is under no
pressure. He will feel he can deal with you without being nagged by his
family. Call on him while he is still jittery. He may be more receptive
when depressed.

See your man alone, if possible. At first engage in general
conversation. After a while, turn the talk to some phase of drinking.
Tell him enough about your drinking habits, symptoms, and experiences to
encourage him to speak of himself. If he wishes to talk, let him do so.
You will thus get a better idea of how you ought to proceed. If he is
not communicative, give him a sketch of your drinking career up to the
time you quit. But say nothing, for the moment, of how that was
accomplished. If he is in a serious mood dwell on the troubles liquor
has caused you, being careful not to moralize or lecture. If his mood is
light, tell him humorous stories of your escapades. Get him to tell some
of his.

When he sees you know all about the drinking game, commence to describe
yourself as an alcoholic. Tell him how baffled you were, how you finally
learned that you were sick. Give him an account of the struggles you
made to stop. Show him the mental twist which leads to the first drink
of a spree. We suggest you do this as we have done it in the chapter on
alcoholism. If he is alcoholic, he will understand you at once. He will
match your mental inconsistencies with some of his own.

If you are satisfied that he is a real alcoholic, begin to dwell on the
hopeless feature of the malady. Show him, from your own experience, how
the queer mental condition surrounding that first drink prevents normal
functioning of the will power. Don't, at this stage, refer to this book,
unless he has seen it and wishes to discuss it. And be careful not to
brand him as an alcoholic. Let him draw his own conclusion. If he sticks
to the idea that he can still control his drinking, tell him that
possibly he can-if he is not too alcoholic. But insist that if he is
severely afflicted, there may be little chance he can recover by
himself.

Continue to speak of alcoholism as an illness, a fatal malady. Talk
about the conditions of body and mind which accompany it. Keep his
attention focused mainly on your personal experience. Explain that many
are doomed who never realize their predicament. Doctors are rightly
loath to tell alcoholic patients the whole story unless it will serve
some good purpose. But you may talk to him about the hopelessness of
alcoholism because you offer a solution. You will soon have your friend
admitting he has many, if not all, of the traits of the alcoholic. If
his own doctor is willing to tell him that he is alcoholic, so much the
better. Even though your protege may not have entirely admitted his
condition, he has become very curious to know how you got well. Let him
ask you that question, if he will. Tell him exactly what happened to
you. Stress the spiritual feature freely. If the man be agnostic or
atheist, make it emphatic that he does not have to agree with your
conception of God. He can choose any conception he likes, provided it
makes sense to him. The main thing is that he be willing to believe in a
Power greater than himself and that he live by spiritual principles.

When dealing with such a person, you had better use everyday language to
describe spiritual principles. There is no use arousing any prejudice he
may have against certain theological terms and conceptions about which
he may already be confused. Don't raise such issues, no matter what your
own convictions are.

Your prospect may belong to a religious denomination. His religious
education and training may be far superior to yours. In that case he is
going to wonder how you can add anything to what he already knows. But
he will be curious to learn why his own convictions have not worked and
why yours seem to work so well. He may be an example of the truth that
faith alone is insufficient. To be vital, faith must be accompanied by
self sacrifice and unselfish, constructive action. Let him see that you
are not there to instruct him in religion. Admit that he probably knows
more about it than you do, but call to his attention the fact that
however deep his faith and knowledge, he could not have applied it or he
would not drink. Perhaps your story will help him see where he has
failed to practice the very precepts he knows so well. We represent no
particular faith or denomination. We are dealing only with general
principles common to most denominations.

Outline the program of action, explaining how you made a self-appraisal,
how you straightened out your past and why you are now endeavoring to be
helpful to him. It is important for him to realize that your attempt to
pass this on to him plays a vital part in your own recovery. Actually,
he may be helping you more than you are helping him. Make it plain he is
under no obligation to you, that you hope only that he will try to help
other alcoholics when he escapes his own difficulties. Suggest how
important it is that he place the welfare of other people ahead of his
own. Make it clear that he is not under pressure, that he needn't see
you again if he doesn't want to. You should not be offended if he wants
to call it off, for he has helped you more than you have helped him. If
your talk has been sane, quiet and full of human understanding, you have
perhaps made a friend. Maybe you have disturbed him about the question
of alcoholism. This is all to the good. The more hopeless he feels, the
better. He will be more likely to follow your suggestions.

Your candidate may give reasons why he need not follow all of the
program. He may rebel at the thought of a drastic housecleaning which
requires discussion with other people. Do not contradict such views.
Tell him you once felt as he does, but you doubt whether you would have
made much progress had you not taken action. On your first visit tell
him about the Fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous. If he shows interest,
lend him your copy of this book.

Unless your friend wants to talk further about himself, do not wear out
your welcome. Give him a chance to think it over. If you do stay, let
him steer the conversation in any direction he likes. Sometimes a new
man is anxious to proceed at once. And you may be tempted to let him do
so. This is sometimes a mistake. If he has trouble later, he is likely
to say you rushed him. You will be most successful with alcoholics if
you do not exhibit any passion for crusade or reform. Never talk down to
an alcoholic from any moral or spiritual hilltop; simply lay out the kit
of spiritual tools for his inspection. Show him how they worked with
you. Offer him friendship and fellowship. Tell him that if he wants to
get well you will do anything to help.

If he is not interested in your solution, if he expects you to act only
as a banker for his financial difficulties or a nurse for his sprees,
you may have to drop him until he changes his mind. This he may do after
he gets hurt some more.

If he is sincerely interested and wants to see you again, ask him to
read this book in the interval. After doing that, he must decide for
himself whether he wants to go on. He should not be pushed or prodded by
you, his wife, or his friends. If he is to find God, the desire must
come from within.

If he thinks he can do the job in some other way, or prefers some other
spiritual approach, encourage him to follow his own conscience. We have
no monopoly on God; we merely have an approach that worked with us. But
point out that we alcoholics have much in common and that you would
like, in any case, to be friendly. Let it go at that.

Do not be discouraged if your prospect does not respond at once. Search
out another alcoholic and try again. You are sure to find someone
desperate enough to accept with eagerness what you offer. We find it a
waste of time to keep chasing a man who cannot or will not work with
you. If you leave such a person alone, he may soon become convinced that
he cannot recover by himself. To spend too much time on any one
situation is to deny some other alcoholic an opportunity to live and be
happy. One of our Fellowship failed entirely with his first half dozen
prospects. He often says that if he had continued to work on them, he
might have deprived many others, who have since recovered, of their
chance.

Suppose now you are making your second visit to a man. He has read this
volume and says he is prepared to go through with the Twelve Steps of
the program of recovery. Having had the experience yourself, you can
give him much practical advice. Let him know you are available if he
wishes to make a decision and tell his story, but do not insist upon it
if he prefers to consult someone else.

He may be broke and homeless. If he is, you might try to help him about
getting a job, or give him a little financial assistance. But you should
not deprive your family or creditors of money they should have. Perhaps
you will want to take the man into your home for a few days. But be sure
you use discretion. Be certain he will be welcomed by your family, and
that he is not trying to impose upon you for money, connections, or
shelter. Permit that and you only harm him. You will be making it
possible for him to be insincere. You may be aiding in his destruction
rather than his recovery.

Never avoid these responsibilities, but be sure you are doing the right
thing if you assume them. Helping others is the foundation stone of your
recovery. A kindly act once in a while isn't enough. You have to act the
Good Samaritan every day, if need be. It may mean the loss of many
nights' sleep, great interference with your pleasures, interruptions to
your business. It may mean sharing your money and your home, counseling
frantic wives and relatives, innumerable trips to police courts,
sanitariums, hospitals, jails and asylums. Your telephone may jangle at
any time of the day or night. Your wife may sometimes say she is
neglected. A drunk may smash the furniture in your home, or burn a
mattress. You may have to fight with him if he is violent. Sometimes you
will have to call a doctor and administer sedatives under his direction.
Another time you may have to send for the police or an ambulance.
Occasionally you will have to meet such conditions.

We seldom allow an alcoholic to live in our homes for long at a time. It
is not good for him, and it sometimes creates serious complications in a
family.

Though an alcoholic does not respond, there is no reason why you should
neglect his family. You should continue to be friendly to them. The
family should be offered your way of life. Should they accept and
practice spiritual principles, there is a much better chance that the
head of the family will recover. And even though he continues to drink,
the family will find life more bearable.

For the type of alcoholic who is able and willing to get well, little
charity, in the ordinary sense of the word, is needed or wanted. The men
who cry for money and shelter before conquering alcohol, are on the
wrong track. Yet we do go to great extremes to provide each other with
these very things, when such action is warranted. This may seem
inconsistent, but we think it is not.

It is not the matter of giving that is in question, but when and how to
give. That often makes the difference between failure and success. The
minute we put our work on a service plane, the alcoholic commences to
rely upon our assistance rather than upon God. He clamors for this or
that, claiming he cannot master alcohol until his material needs are
cared for. Nonsense. Some of us have taken very hard knocks to learn
this truth: Job or no job-wife or no wife-we simply do not stop drinking
so long as we place dependence upon other people ahead of dependence on
God.

Burn the idea into the consciousness of every man that he can get well
regardless of anyone. The only condition is that he trust in God and
clean house.

Now, the domestic problem: There may be divorce, separation, or just
strained relations. When your prospect has made such reparation as he
can to his family, and has thoroughly explained to them the new
principles by which he is living, he should proceed to put those
principles into action at home. That is, if he is lucky enough to have a
home. Though his family be at fault in many respects, he should not be
concerned about that. He should concentrate on his own spiritual
demonstration. Argument and fault-finding are to be avoided like the
plague. In many homes this is a difficult thing to do, but it must be
done if any results are to be expected. If persisted in for a few
months, the effect on a man's family is sure to be great. The most
incompatible people discover they have a basis upon which they can meet.
Little by little the family may see their own defects and admit them.
These can then be discussed in an atmosphere of helpfulness and
friendliness.

After they have seen tangible results, the family will perhaps want to
go along. These things will come to pass naturally and in good time
provided, however, the alcoholic continues to demonstrate that he can be
sober, considerate, and helpful, regardless of what anyone says or does.
Of course, we all fall much below this standard many times. But we must
try to repair the damage immediately lest we pay the penalty by a spree.

If there be divorce or separation, there should be no undue haste for
the couple to get together. The man should be sure of his recovery. The
wife should fully understand his new way of life. If their old
relationship is to be resumed it must be on a better basis, since the
former did not work. This means a new attitude and spirit all around.
Sometimes it is to the best interest of all concerned that a couple
remain apart. Obviously, no rule can be laid down. Let the alcoholic
continue his program day by day. When the time for living together has
come, it will be apparent to both parties.

Let no alcoholic say he cannot recover unless he has his family back.
This just isn't so. In some cases the wife will never come back for one
reason or another. Remind the prospect that his recovery is not
dependent upon people. It is dependent upon his relationship with God.
We have seen men get well whose families have not returned at all. We
have seen others slip when the family came back too soon.

Both you and the new man must walk day by day in the path of spiritual
progress. If you persist, remarkable things will happen. When we look
back, we realize that the things which came to us when we put ourselves
in God's hands were better than anything we could have planned. Follow
the dictates of a Higher Power and you will presently live in a new and
wonderful world, no matter what your present circumstances!

When working with a man and his family, you should take care not to
participate in their quarrels. You may spoil your chance of being
helpful if you do. But urge upon a man's family that he has been a very
sick person and should be treated accordingly. You should warn against
arousing resentment or jealousy. You should point out that his defects
of character are not going to disappear over night. Show them that he
has entered upon a period of growth. Ask them to remember, when they are
impatient, the blessed fact of his sobriety.

If you have been successful in solving your own domestic problems, tell
the newcomer's family how that was accomplished. In this way you can set
them on the right track without becoming critical of them. The story of
how you and your wife settled your difficulties is worth any amount of
criticism.

Assuming we are spiritually fit, we can do all sorts of things
alcoholics are not supposed to do. People have said we must not go where
liquor is served; we must not have it in our homes; we must shun friends
who drink; we must avoid moving pictures which show drinking scenes; we
must not go into bars; our friends must hide their bottles if we go to
their houses; we mustn't think or be reminded about alcohol at all. Our
experience shows that this is not necessarily so.

We meet these conditions every day. An alcoholic who cannot meet them,
still has an alcoholic mind; there is something the matter with his
spiritual status. His only chance for sobriety would be some place like
the Greenland Ice Cap, and even there an Eskimo might turn up with a
bottle of scotch and ruin everything! Ask any woman who has sent her
husband to distant places on the theory he would escape the alcohol
problem.

In our belief any scheme of combating alcoholism which proposes to
shield the sick man from temptation is doomed to failure. If the
alcoholic tries to shield himself he may succeed for a time, but he
usually winds up with a bigger explosion than ever. We have tried these
methods. These attempts to do the impossible have always failed.

So our rule is not to avoid a place where there is drinking, if we have
a legitimate reason for being there. That includes bars, nightclubs,
dances, receptions, weddings, even plain ordinary whoopee parties. To a
person who has had experience with an alcoholic, this may seem like
tempting Providence, but it isn't.

You will note that we made an important qualification. Therefore, ask
yourself on each occasion, \"Have I any good social, business, or
personal reason for going to this place? Or am I expecting to steal a
little vicarious pleasure from the atmosphere of such places?\" If you
answer these questions satisfactorily, you need have no apprehension. Go
or stay away, whichever seems best. But be sure you are on solid
spiritual ground before you start and that your motive in going is
thoroughly good. Do not think of what you will get out of the occasion.
Think of what you can bring to it. But if you are shaky, you had better
work with another alcoholic instead!

Why sit with a long face in places where there is drinking, sighing
about the good old days. If it is a happy occasion, try to increase the
pleasure of those there; if a business occasion, go and attend to your
business enthusiastically. If you are with a person who wants to eat in
a bar, by all means go along. Let your friends know they are not to
change their habits on your account. At a proper time and place explain
to all your friends why alcohol disagrees with you. If you do this
thoroughly, few people will ask you to drink. While you were drinking,
you were withdrawing from life little by little. Now you are getting
back into the social life of this world. Don't start to withdraw again
just because your friends drink liquor.

Your job now is to be at the place where you may be of maximum
helpfulness to others, so never hesitate to go anywhere if you can be
helpful. You should not hesitate to visit the most sordid spot on earth
on such an errand. Keep on the firing line of life with these motives
and God will keep you unharmed.

Many of us keep liquor in our homes. We often need it to carry green
recruits through a severe hangover Some of us still serve it to our
friends provided they are not alcoholic. But some of us think we should
not serve liquor to anyone. We never argue this question. We feel that
each family, in the light of their own circumstances, ought to decide
for themselves.

We are careful never to show intolerance or hatred of drinking as an
institution. Experience shows that such an attitude is not helpful to
anyone. Every new alcoholic looks for this spirit among us and is
immensely relieved when he finds we are not witch burners. A spirit of
intolerance might repel alcoholics whose lives could have been saved,
had it not been for such stupidity. We would not even do the cause of
temperate drinking any good, for not one drinker in a thousand likes to
be told anything about alcohol by one who hates it.

Some day we hope that Alcoholics Anonymous will help the public to a
better realization of the gravity of the alcoholic problem, but we shall
be of little use if our attitude is one of bitterness or hostility.
Drinkers will not stand for it.

After all, our problems were of our own making. Bottles were only a
symbol. Besides, we have stopped fighting anybody or anything. We have
to!

## To Wives

WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, our book thus far has spoken of men. But what we
have said applies quite as much to women. Our activities in behalf of
women who drink are on the increase. There is every evidence that women
regain their health as readily as men if they try our suggestions.

But for every man who drinks others are involved-the wife who trembles
in fear of the next debauch; the mother and father who see their son
wasting away.

Among us are wives, relatives and friends whose problem has been solved,
as well as some who have not yet found a happy solution. We want the
wives of Alcoholics Anonymous to address the wives of men who drink too
much. What they say will apply to nearly everyone bound by ties of blood
or affection to an alcoholic.

As wives of Alcoholics Anonymous, we would like you to feel that we
understand as perhaps few can. We want to analyze mistakes we have made.
We want to leave you with the feeling that no situation is too difficult
and no unhappiness too great to be overcome.

We have traveled a rocky road, there is no mistake about that. We have
had long rendezvous with hurt pride, frustration, self-pity,
misunderstanding and fear. These are not pleasant companions. We have
been driven to maudlin sympathy, to bitter resentment. Some of us veered
from extreme to extreme, ever hoping that one day our loved ones would
be themselves once more.

Our loyalty and the desire that our husbands hold up their heads and be
like other men have begotten all sorts of predicaments. We have been
unselfish and self-sacrificing. We have told innumerable lies to protect
our pride and our husbands' reputations. We have prayed, we have begged,
we have been patient. We have struck out viciously. We have run away. We
have been hysterical. We have been terror stricken. We have sought
sympathy. We have had retaliatory love affairs with other men.

Our homes have been battle-grounds many an evening. In the morning we
have kissed and made up. Our friends have counseled chucking the men and
we have done so with finality, only to be back in a little while hoping,
always hoping. Our men have sworn great solemn oaths that they were
through drinking forever. We have believed them when no one else could
or would. Then, in days, weeks, or months, a fresh outburst.

We seldom had friends at our homes, never knowing how or when the men of
the house would appear. We could make few social engagements. We came to
live almost alone. When we were invited out, our husbands sneaked so
many drinks that they spoiled the occasion. If, on the other hand, they
took nothing, their self-pity made them killjoys.

There was never financial security. Positions were always in jeopardy or
gone. An armored car could not have brought the pay envelopes home. The
checking account melted like snow in June.

Sometimes there were other women. How heartbreaking was this discovery;
how cruel to be told they understood our men as we did not!

The bill collectors, the sheriffs, the angry taxi drivers, the
policemen, the bums, the pals, and even the ladies they sometimes
brought home-our husbands thought we were so inhospitable. \"Joykiller,
nag, wet blanket\"-that's what they said. Next day they would be
themselves again and we would forgive and try to forget.

We have tried to hold the love of our children for their father. We have
told small tots that father was sick, which was much nearer the truth
than we realized. They struck the children, kicked out door panels,
smashed treasured crockery, and ripped the keys out of pianos. In the
midst of such pandemonium they may have rushed out threatening to live
with the other woman forever. In desperation, we have even got tight
ourselves-the drunk to end all drunks. The unexpected result was that
our husbands seemed to like it.

Perhaps at this point we got a divorce and took the children home to
father and mother. Then we were severely criticized by our husband's
parents for desertion. Usually we did not leave. We stayed on and on. We
finally sought employment ourselves as destitution faced us and our
families.

We began to ask medical advice as the sprees got closer together. The
alarming physical and mental symptoms, the deepening pall of remorse,
depression and inferiority that settled down on our loved ones-these
things terrified and distracted us. As animals on a treadmill, we have
patiently and wearily climbed, falling back in exhaustion after each
futile effort to reach solid ground. Most of us have entered the final
stage with its commitment to health resorts, sanitariums, hospitals, and
jails. Sometimes there were screaming delirium and insanity. Death was
often near.

Under these conditions we naturally made mistakes. Some of them rose out
of ignorance of alcoholism. Sometimes we sensed dimly that we were
dealing with sick men. Had we fully understood the nature of the
alcoholic illness, we might have behaved differently.

How could men who loved their wives and children be so unthinking, so
callous, so cruel? There could be no love in such persons, we thought.
And just as we were being convinced of their heartlessness, they would
surprise us with fresh resolves and new attentions. For a while they
would be their old sweet selves, only to dash the new structure of
affection to pieces once more. Asked why they commenced to drink again,
they would reply with some silly excuse, or none. It was so baffling, so
heartbreaking. Could we have been so mistaken in the men we married?
When drinking, they were strangers. Sometimes they were so inaccessible
that it seemed as though a great wall had been built around them.

And even if they did not love their families, how could they be so blind
about themselves? What had become of their judgment, their common sense,
their will power? Why could they not see that drink meant ruin to them?
Why was it, when these dangers were pointed out that they agreed, and
then got drunk again immediately?

These are some of the questions which race through the mind of every
woman who has an alcoholic husband. We hope this book has answered some
of them. Perhaps your husband has been living in that strange world of
alcoholism where everything is distorted and exaggerated. You can see
that he really does love you with his better self. Of course, there is
such a thing as incompatibility, but in nearly every instance the
alcoholic only seems to be unloving and inconsiderate; it is usually
because he is warped and sickened that he says and does these appalling
things. Today most of our men are better husbands and fathers than ever
before.

Try not to condemn your alcoholic husband no matter what he says or
does. He is just another very sick, unreasonable person. Treat him, when
you can, as though he had pneumonia. When he angers you, remember that
he is very ill.

There is an important exception to the foregoing. We realize some men
are thoroughly bad-intentioned, that no amount of patience will make any
difference. An alcoholic of this temperament may be quick to use this
chapter as a club over your head. Don't let him get away with it. If you
are positive he is one of this type you may feel you had better leave.
Is it right to let him ruin your life and the lives of your children?
Especially when he has before him a way to stop his drinking and abuse
if he really wants to pay the price.

The problem with which you struggle usually falls within one of four
categories:

One: Your husband may be only a heavy drinker. His drinking may be
constant or it may be heavy only on certain occasions. Perhaps he spends
too much money for liquor. It may be slowing him up mentally and
physically, but he does not see it. Sometimes he is a source of
embarrassment to you and his friends. He is positive he can handle his
liquor, that it does him no harm, that drinking is necessary in his
business. He would probably be insulted if he were called an alcoholic.
This world is full of people like him. Some will moderate or stop
altogether, and some will not. Of those who keep on, a good number will
become true alcoholics after a while.

Two: Your husband is showing lack of control, for he is unable to stay
on the water wagon even when he wants to. He often gets entirely out of
hand when drinking. He admits this is true, but is positive that he will
do better. He has begun to try, with or without your cooperation,
various means of moderating or staying dry. Maybe he is beginning to
lose his friends. His business may suffer somewhat. He is worried at
times, and is becoming aware that he cannot drink like other people. He
sometimes drinks in the morning and through the day also, to hold his
nervousness in check. He is remorseful after serious drinking bouts and
tells you he wants to stop. But when he gets over the spree, he begins
to think once more how he can drink moderately next time. We think this
person is in danger. These are the earmarks of a real alcoholic. Perhaps
he can still tend to business fairly well. He has by no means ruined
everything. As we say among ourselves, \"He wants to want to stop.\"

Three: This husband has gone much further than husband number two.
Though once like number two he became worse. His friends have slipped
away, his home is a near-wreck and he cannot hold a position. Maybe the
doctor has been called in, and the weary round of sanitariums and
hospitals has begun. He admits he cannot drink like other people, but
does not see why. He clings to the notion that he will yet find a way to
do so. He may have come to the point where he desperately wants to stop
but cannot. His case presents additional questions which we shall try to
answer for you. You can be quite hopeful of a situation like this.

Four: You may have a husband of whom you completely despair. He has been
placed in one institution after another. He is violent, or appears
definitely insane when drunk. Sometimes he drinks on the way home from
the hospital. Perhaps he has had delirium tremens. Doctors may shake
their heads and advise you to have him committed. Maybe you have already
been obliged to put him away. This picture may not be as dark as it
looks. Many of our husbands were just as far gone. Yet they got well.

Let's now go back to husband number one. Oddly enough, he is often
difficult to deal with. He enjoys drinking. It stirs his imagination.
His friends feel closer over a highball. Perhaps you enjoy drinking with
him yourself when he doesn't go too far. You have passed happy evenings
together chatting and drinking before your fire. Perhaps you both like
parties which would be dull without liquor. We have enjoyed such
evenings ourselves; we had a good time. We know all about liquor as a
social lubricant. Some, but not all of us, think it has its advantages
when reasonably used.

The first principle of success is that you should never be angry. Even
though your husband becomes unbearable and you have to leave him
temporarily, you should, if you can, go without rancor. Patience and
good temper are most necessary.

Our next thought is that you should never tell him what he must do about
his drinking. If he gets the idea that you are a nag or killjoy, your
chance of accomplishing anything useful may be zero. He will use that as
an excuse to drink more. He will tell you he is misunderstood. This may
lead to lonely evenings for you. He may seek someone else to console
him-not always another man.

Be determined that your husband's drinking is not going to spoil your
relations with your children or your friends. They need your
companionship and your help. It is possible to have a full and useful
life, though your husband continues to drink. We know women who are
unafraid, even happy under these conditions. Do not set your heart on
reforming your husband. You may be unable to do so, no matter how hard
you try.

We know these suggestions are sometimes difficult to follow, but you
will save many a heartbreak if you can succeed in observing them. Your
husband may come to appreciate your reasonableness and patience. This
may lay the groundwork for a friendly talk about his alcoholic problem.
Try to have him bring up the subject himself. Be sure you are not
critical during such a discussion. Attempt instead, to put yourself in
his place. Let him see that you want to be helpful rather than critical.

When a discussion does arise, you might suggest he read this book or at
least the chapter on alcoholism. Tell him you have been worried, though
perhaps needlessly. You think he ought to know the subject better, as
everyone should have a clear understanding of the risk he takes if he
drinks too much. Show him you have confidence in his power to stop or
moderate. Say you do not want to be a wet blanket; that you only want
him to take care of his health. Thus you may succeed in interesting him
in alcoholism.

He probably has several alcoholics among his own acquaintances. You
might suggest that you both take an interest in them. Drinkers like to
help other drinkers. Your husband may be willing to talk to one of them.

If this kind of approach does not catch your husband's interest, it may
be best to drop the subject, but after a friendly talk your husband will
usually revive the topic himself. This may take patient waiting, but it
will be worth it. Meanwhile you might try to help the wife of another
serious drinker. If you act upon these principles, your husband may stop
or moderate.

Suppose, however, that your husband fits the description of number two.
The same principles which apply to husband number one should be
practiced. But after his next binge, ask him if he would really like to
get over drinking for good. Do not ask that he do it for you or anyone
else. Just would he like to?

The chances are he would. Show him your copy of this book and tell him
what you have found out about alcoholism. Show him that as alcoholics,
the writers of the book understand. Tell him some of the interesting
stories you have read. If you think he will be shy of a spiritual
remedy, ask him to look at the chapter on alcoholism. Then perhaps he
will be interested enough to continue.

If he is enthusiastic your cooperation will mean a great deal. If he is
lukewarm or thinks he is not an alcoholic, we suggest you leave him
alone. Avoid urging him to follow our program. The seed has been planted
in his mind. He knows that thousands of men, much like himself, have
recovered. But don't remind him of this after he had been drinking, for
he may be angry. Sooner or later, you are likely to find him reading the
book once more. Wait until repeated stumbling convinces him he must act,
for the more you hurry him the longer his recovery may be delayed.

If you have a number three husband, you may be in luck. Being certain he
wants to stop, you can go to him with this volume as joyfully as though
you had struck oil. He may not share your enthusiasm, but he is
practically sure to read the book and he may go for the program at once.
If he does not, you will probably not have long to wait. Again, you
should not crowd him. Let him decide for himself. Cheerfully see him
through more sprees. Talk about his condition or this book only when he
raises the issue. In some cases it may be better to let someone outside
the family present the book. They can urge action without arousing
hostility. If your husband is otherwise a normal individual, your
chances are good at this stage.

You would suppose that men in the fourth classification would be quite
hopeless, but that is not so. Many of Alcoholics Anonymous were like
that. Everybody had given them up. Defeat seemed certain. Yet often such
men had spectacular and powerful recoveries.

There are exceptions. Some men have been so impaired by alcohol that
they cannot stop. Sometimes there are cases where alcoholism is
complicated by other disorders. A good doctor or psychiatrist can tell
you whether these complications are serious. In any event, try to have
your husband read this book. His reaction may be one of enthusiasm. If
he is already committed to an institution, but can convince you and your
doctor that he means business, give him a chance to try our method,
unless the doctor thinks his mental condition too abnormal or dangerous.
We make this recommendation with some confidence. For years we have been
working with alcoholics committed to institutions. Since this book was
first published, A.A. has released thousands of alcoholics from asylums
and hospitals of every kind. The majority have never returned. The power
of God goes deep!

You may have the reverse situation on your hands. Perhaps you have a
husband who is at large, but who should be committed. Some men cannot or
will not get over alcoholism. When they become too dangerous, we think
the kind thing is to lock them up, but of course a good doctor should
always be consulted. The wives and children of such men suffer horribly,
but not more than the men themselves.

But sometimes you must start life anew. We know women who have done it.
If such women adopt a spiritual way of life their road will be smoother.

If your husband is a drinker, you probably worry over what other people
are thinking and you hate to meet your friends. You draw more and more
into yourself and you think everyone is talking about conditions at your
home. You avoid the subject of drinking, even with your own parents. You
do not know what to tell the children. When your husband is bad, you
become a trembling recluse, wishing the telephone had never been
invented.

We find that most of this embarrassment is unnecessary. While you need
not discuss your husband at length, you can quietly let your friends
know the nature of his illness. But you must be on guard not to
embarrass or harm your husband.

When you have carefully explained to such people that he is a sick
person, you will have created a new atmosphere. Barriers which have
sprung up between you and your friends will disappear with the growth of
sympathetic understanding. You will no longer be self-conscious or feel
that you must apologize as though your husband were a weak character. He
may be anything but that. Your new courage, good nature and lack of
self-consciousness will do wonders for you socially.

The same principle applies in dealing with the children. Unless they
actually need protection from their father, it is best not to take sides
in any argument he has with them while drinking. Use your energies to
promote a better understanding all around. Then that terrible tension
which grips the home of every problem drinker will be lessened.

Frequently, you have felt obliged to tell your husband's employer and
his friends that he was sick, when as a matter of fact he was tight.
Avoid answering these inquiries as much as you can. Whenever possible,
let your husband explain. Your desire to protect him should not cause
you to lie to people when they have a right to know were he is and what
he is doing. Discuss this with him when he is sober and in good spirits.
Ask him what you should do if he places you in such a position again.
But be careful not to be resentful about the last time he did so.

There is another paralyzing fear. You may be afraid your husband will
lose his position; you are thinking of the disgrace and hard times which
will befall you and the children. This experience may come to you. Or
you may already have had it several times. Should it happen again,
regard it in a different light. Maybe it will prove a blessing! It may
convince your husband he wants to stop drinking forever. And now you
know that he can stop if he will! Time after time, this apparent
calamity has been a boon to us, for it opened up a path which led to the
discovery of God.

We have elsewhere remarked how much better life is when lived on a
spiritual plane. If God can solve the age-old riddle of alcoholism, He
can solve your problems too. We wives found that, like everybody else,
we were afflicted with pride, self-pity, vanity and all the things which
go to make up the self-centered person; and we were not above
selfishness or dishonesty. As our husbands began to apply spiritual
principles in their lives, we began to see the desirability of doing so
too.

At first, some of us did not believe we needed this help. We thought, on
the whole, we were pretty good women, capable of being nicer if our
husbands stopped drinking. But it was a silly idea that we were too good
to need God. Now we try to put spiritual principles to work in every
department of our lives. When we do that, we find it solves our problems
too; the ensuing lack of fear, worry and hurt feelings is a wonderful
thing. We urge you to try our program, for nothing will be so helpful to
your husband as the radically changed attitude toward him which God will
show you how to have. Go along with your husband if you possibly can.

If you and your husband find a solution for the pressing problem of
drink you are, of course, going to be very happy. But all problems will
not be solved at once. Seed has started to sprout in a new soil, but
growth has only begun. In spite of your new-found happiness, there will
be ups and downs. Many of the old problems will still be with you. This
is as it should be.

The faith and sincerity of both you and your husband will be put to the
test. These work-outs should be regarded as part of your education, for
thus you will be learning to live. You will make mistakes, but if you
are in earnest they will not drag you down. Instead, you will capitalize
them. A better way of life will emerge when they are overcome.

Some of the snags you will encounter are irritation, hurt feelings and
resentments. Your husband will sometimes be unreasonable and you will
want to criticize. Starting from a speck on the domestic horizon, great
thunderclouds of dispute may gather. These family dissensions are very
dangerous, especially to your husband. Often you must carry the burden
of avoiding them or keeping them under control. Never forget that
resentment is a deadly hazard to an alcoholic. We do not mean that you
have to agree with your husband whenever there is an honest difference
of opinion. Just be careful not to disagree in a resentful or critical
spirit.

You and your husband will find that you can dispose of serious problems
easier than you can the trivial ones. Next time you and he have a heated
discussion, no matter what the subject, it should be the privilege of
either to smile and say, \"This is getting serious. I'm sorry I got
disturbed. Let's talk about it later.\" If your husband is trying to
live on a spiritual basis, he will also be doing everything in his power
to avoid disagreement or contention.

Your husband knows he owes you more than sobriety. He wants to make
good. Yet you must not expect too much. His ways of thinking and doing
are the habits of years. Patience, tolerance, understanding and love are
the watchwords. Show him these things in yourself and they will be
reflected back to you from him. Live and let live is the rule. If you
both show a willingness to remedy your own defects, there will be little
need to criticize each other.

We women carry with us a picture of the ideal man, the sort of chap we
would like our husbands to be. It is the most natural thing in the
world, once his liquor problem is solved, to feel that he will now
measure up to that cherished vision. The chances are he will not for,
like yourself, he is just beginning his development. Be patient.

Another feeling we are very likely to entertain is one of resentment
that love and loyalty could not cure our husbands of alcoholism. We do
not like the thought that the contents of a book or the work of another
alcoholic has accomplished in a few weeks that for which we struggled
for years. At such moments we forget that alcoholism is an illness over
which we could not possibly have had any power. Your husband will be the
first to say it was your devotion and care which brought him to the
point where he could have a spiritual experience. Without you he would
have gone to pieces long ago. When resentful thoughts come, try to pause
and count your blessings. After all, your family is reunited, alcohol is
no longer a problem and you and your husband are working together toward
an undreamed-of future.

Still another difficulty is that you may become jealous of the attention
he bestows on other people, especially alcoholics. You have been
starving for his companionship, yet he spends long hours helping other
men and their families. You feel he should now be yours. The fact is
that he should work with other people to maintain his own sobriety.
Sometimes he will be so interested that he becomes really neglectful.
Your house is filled with strangers. You may not like some of them. He
gets stirred up about their troubles, but not at all about yours. It
will do little good if you point that out and urge more attention for
yourself. We find it a real mistake to dampen his enthusiasm for
alcoholic work. You should join in his efforts as much as you possibly
can. We suggest that you direct some of your thought to the wives of his
new alcoholic friends. They need the counsel and love of a woman who has
gone through what you have.

It is probably true that you and your husband have been living too much
alone, for drinking many times isolates the wife of an alcoholic.
Therefore, you probably need fresh interests and a great cause to live
for as much as your husband. If you cooperate, rather than complain, you
will find that his excess enthusiasm will tone down. Both of you will
awaken to a new sense of responsibility for others. You, as well as your
husband, ought to think of what you can put into life instead of how
much you can take out. Inevitably your lives will be fuller for doing
so. You will lose the old life to find one much better.

Perhaps your husband will make a fair start on the new basis, but just
as things are going beautifully he dismays you by coming home drunk. If
you are satisfied he really wants to get over drinking, you need not be
alarmed. Though it is infinitely better that he have no relapse at all,
as has been true with many of our men, it is by no means a bad thing in
some cases. Your husband will see at once that he must redouble his
spiritual activities if he expects to survive. You need not remind him
of his spiritual deficiency-he will know of it. Cheer him up and ask him
how you can be still more helpful.

The slightest sign of fear or intolerance may lessen your husband's
chance of recovery. In a weak moment he may take your dislike of his
high-stepping friends as one of those insanely trivial excuses to drink.

We never, never try to arrange a man's life so as to shield him from
temptation. The slightest disposition on your part to guide his
appointments or his affairs so he will not be tempted will be noticed.
Make him feel absolutely free to come and go as he likes. This is
important. If he gets drunk, don't blame yourself. God has either
removed your husband's liquor problem or He has not. If not, it had
better be found out right away. Then you and your husband can get right
down to fundamentals. If a repetition is to be prevented, place the
problem, along with everything else, in God's hands.

We realize that we have been giving you much direction and advice. We
may have seemed to lecture. If that is so we are sorry, for we ourselves
don't always care for people who lecture us. But what we have related is
based upon experience, some of it painful. We had to learn these things
the hard way. That is why we are anxious that you understand, and that
you avoid these unnecessary difficulties.

So to you out there-who may soon be with us-we say \"Good luck and God
bless you!\"

## The Family Afterwords

OUR WOMEN FOLK have suggested certain attitudes a wife may take with the
husband who is recovering. Perhaps they created the impression that he
is to be wrapped in cotton wool and placed on a pedestal. Successful
readjustment means the opposite. All members of the family should meet
upon the common ground of tolerance, understanding and love. This
involves a process of deflation. The alcoholic, his wife, his children,
his \"in-laws,\" each one is likely to have fixed ideas about the
family's attitude towards himself or herself. Each is interested in
having his or her wishes respected. We find the more one member of the
family demands that the others concede to him, the more resentful they
become. This makes for discord and unhappiness.

And why? Is it not because each wants to play the lead? Is not each
trying to arrange the family show to his liking? Is he not unconsciously
trying to see what he can take from the family life rather than give?

Cessation of drinking is but the first step away from a highly strained,
abnormal condition. A doctor said to us, \"Years of living with an
alcoholic is almost sure to make any wife or child neurotic. The entire
family is, to some extent, ill.\" Let families realize, as they start
their journey, that all will not be fair weather. Each in his turn may
be footsore and may straggle. There will be alluring shortcuts and
by-paths down which they may wander and lose their way.

Suppose we tell you some of the obstacles a family will meet; suppose we
suggest how they may be avoided-even converted to good use for others.
The family of an alcoholic longs for the return of happiness and
security. They remember when father was romantic, thoughtful and
successful. Today's life is measured against that of other years and,
when it falls short, the family may be unhappy.

Family confidence in dad is rising high. The good old days will soon be
back, they think. Sometimes they demand that dad bring them back
instantly! God, they believe, almost owes this recompense on a long
overdue account. But the head of the house has spent years in pulling
down the structures of business, romance, friendship, health-these
things are now ruined or damaged. It will take time to clear away the
wreck. Though old buildings will eventually be replaced by finer ones,
the new structures will take years to complete.

Father knows he is to blame; it may take him many seasons of hard work
to be restored financially, but he shouldn't be reproached. Perhaps he
will never have much money again. But the wise family will admire him
for what he is trying to be, rather than for what he is trying to get.

Now and then the family will be plagued by spectres from the past, for
the drinking career of almost every alcoholic has been marked by
escapades, funny, humiliating, shameful or tragic. The first impulse
will be to bury these skeletons in a dark closet and padlock the door.
The family may be possessed by the idea that future happiness can be
based only upon forgetfulness of the past. We think that such a view is
self-centered and in direct conflict with the new way of living.

Henry Ford once made a wise remark to the effect that experience is the
thing of supreme value in life. That is true only if one is willing to
turn the past to good account. We grow by our willingness to face and
rectify errors and convert them into assets. The alcoholic's past thus
becomes the principal asset of the family and frequently it is almost
the only one!

This painful past may be of infinite value to other families still
struggling with their problem. We think each family which has been
relieved owes something to those who have not, and when the occasion
requires, each member of it should be only too willing to bring former
mistakes, no matter how grievous, out of their hiding places. Showing
others who suffer how we were given help is the very thing which makes
life seem so worth while to us now. Cling to the thought that, in God's
hands, the dark past is the greatest possession you have-the key to life
and happiness for others. With it you can avert death and misery for
them.

It is possible to dig up past misdeeds so they become a blight, a
veritable plague. For example, we know of situations in which the
alcoholic or his wife have had love affairs. In the first flush of
spiritual experience they forgave each other and drew closer together.
The miracle of reconciliation was at hand. Then, under one provocation
or another, the aggrieved one would unearth the old affair and angrily
cast its ashes about. A few of us have had these growing pains and they
hurt a great deal. Husbands and wives have sometimes been obliged to
separate for a time until new perspective, new victory over hurt pride
could be re-won. In most cases, the alcoholic survived this ordeal
without relapse, but not always. So we think that unless some good and
useful purpose is to be served, past occurrences should not be
discussed.

We families of Alcoholics Anonymous keep few skeletons in the closet.
Everyone knows about the others' alcoholic troubles. This is a condition
which, in ordinary life, would produce untold grief; there might be
scandalous gossip, laughter at the expense of other people, and a
tendency to take advantage of intimate information. Among us, these are
rare occurrences. We do talk about each other a great deal, but we
almost invariably temper such talk by a spirit of love and tolerance.

Another principle we observe carefully is that we do not relate intimate
experiences of another person unless we are sure he would approve. We
find it better, when possible, to stick to our own stories. A man may
criticize or laugh at himself and it will affect others favorably, but
criticism or ridicule coming from another often produces the contrary
effect. Members of a family should watch such matters carefully, for one
careless, inconsiderate remark has been known to raise the very devil.
We alcoholics are sensitive people. It takes some of us a long time to
outgrow that serious handicap.

Many alcoholics are enthusiasts. They run to extremes. At the beginning
of recovery a man will take, as a rule, one of two directions. He may
either plunge into a frantic attempt to get on his feet in business, or
he may be so enthralled by his new life that he talks or thinks of
little else. In either case certain family problems will arise. With
these we have had experience galore.

We think it dangerous if he rushes headlong at his economic problem. The
family will be affected also, pleasantly at first, as they feel their
money troubles are about to be solved, then not so pleasantly as they
find themselves neglected. Dad may be tired at night and preoccupied by
day. He may take small interest in the children and may show irritation
when reproved for his delinquencies. If not irritable, he may seem dull
and boring, not gay and affectionate as the family would like him to be.
Mother may complain of inattention. They are all disappointed, and often
let him feel it. Beginning with such complaints, a barrier arises. He is
straining every nerve to make up for lost time. He is striving to
recover fortune and reputation and feels he is doing very well.

Sometimes mother and children don't think so. Having been neglected and
misused in the past, they think father owes them more than they are
getting. They want him to make a fuss over them. They expect him to give
them the nice times they used to have before he drank so much, and to
show his contrition for what they suffered. But dad doesn't give freely
of himself. Resentment grows. He becomes still less communicative.
Sometimes he explodes over a trifle. The family is mystified. They
criticize, pointing out how he is falling down on his spiritual program.

This sort of thing can be avoided. Both father and the family are
mistaken, though each side may have some justification. It is of little
use to argue and only makes the impasse worse. The family must realize
that dad, though marvelously improved, is still convalescing. They
should be thankful he is sober and able to be of this world once more.
Let them praise his progress. Let them remember that his drinking
wrought all kinds of damage that may take long to repair. If they sense
these things, they will not take so seriously his periods of crankiness,
depression, or apathy, which will disappear when there is tolerance,
love, and spiritual understanding.

The head of the house ought to remember that he is mainly to blame for
what befell his home. He can scarcely square the account in his
lifetime. But he must see the danger of over-concentration on financial
success. Although financial recovery is on the way for many of us, we
found we could not place money first. For us, material well-being always
followed spiritual progress; it never preceded.

Since the home has suffered more than anything else, it is well that a
man exert himself there. He is not likely to get far in any direction if
he fails to show unselfishness and love under his own roof. We know
there are difficult wives and families, but the man who is getting over
alcoholism must remember he did much to make them so.

As each member of a resentful family begins to see his shortcomings and
admits them to the others, he lays a basis for helpful discussion. These
family talks will be constructive if they can be carried on without
heated argument, self-pity, self-justification or resentful criticism.
Little by little, mother and children will see they ask too much, and
father will see he gives too little. Giving, rather than getting, will
become the guiding principle.

Assume on the other hand that father has, at the outset, a stirring
spiritual experience. Overnight, as it were, he is a different man. He
becomes a religious enthusiast. He is unable to focus on anything else.
As soon as his sobriety begins to be taken as a matter of course, the
family may look at their strange new dad with apprehension, then with
irritation. There is talk about spiritual matters morning, noon and
night. He may demand that the family find God in a hurry, or exhibit
amazing indifference to them and say he is above worldly considerations.
He may tell mother, who has been religious all her life, that she
doesn't know what it's all about, and that she had better get his brand
of spirituality while there is yet time.

When father takes this tack, the family may react unfavorably. They may
be jealous of a God who has stolen dad's affections. While grateful that
he drinks no more, they may not like the idea that God has accomplished
the miracle where they failed. They often forget father was beyond human
aid. They may not see why their love and devotion did not straighten him
out. Dad is not so spiritual after all, they say. If he means to right
his past wrongs, why all this concern for everyone in the world but his
family? What about his talk that God will take care of them? They
suspect father is a bit balmy!

He is not so unbalanced as they might think. Many of us have experienced
dad's elation. We have indulged in spiritual intoxication. Like a gaunt
prospector, belt drawn in over the last ounce of food, our pick struck
gold. Joy at our release from a lifetime of frustration knew no bounds.
Father feels he has struck something better than gold. For a time he may
try to hug the new treasure to himself. He may not see at once that he
has barely scratched a limitless lode which will pay dividends only if
he mines it for the rest of his life and insists on giving away the
entire product.

If the family cooperates, dad will soon see that he is suffering from a
distortion of values. He will perceive that his spiritual growth is
lopsided, that for an average man like himself, a spiritual life which
does not include his family obligations may not be so perfect after all.
If the family will appreciate that dad's current behavior is but a phase
of his development, all will be well. In the midst of an understanding
and sympathetic family, these vagaries of dad's spiritual infancy will
quickly disappear.

The opposite may happen should the family condemn and criticize. Dad may
feel that for years his drinking has placed him on the wrong side of
every argument, but that now he has become a superior person with God on
his side. If the family persists in criticism, this fallacy may take a
still greater hold on father. Instead of treating the family as he
should, he may retreat further into himself and feel he has spiritual
justification for so doing.

Though the family does not fully agree with dad's spiritual activities,
they should let him have his head. Even if he displays a certain amount
of neglect and irresponsibility towards the family, it is well to let
him go as far as he likes in helping other alcoholics. During those
first days of convalescence, this will do more to insure his sobriety
than anything else. Though some of his manifestations are alarming and
disagreeable, we think dad will be on a firmer foundation than the man
who is placing business or professional success ahead of spiritual
development. He will be less likely to drink again, and anything is
preferable to that.

Those of us who have spent much time in the world of spiritual
make-believe have eventually seen the childishness of it. This dream
world has been replaced by a great sense of purpose, accompanied by a
growing consciousness of the power of God in our lives. We have come to
believe He would like us to keep our heads in the clouds with Him, but
that our feet ought to be firmly planted on earth. That is where our
fellow travelers are, and that is where our work must be done. These are
the realities for us. We have found nothing incompatible between a
powerful spiritual experience and a life of sane and happy usefulness.

One more suggestion: Whether the family has spiritual convictions or
not, they may do well to examine the principles by which the alcoholic
member is trying to live. They can hardly fail to approve these simple
principles, though the head of the house still fails somewhat in
practicing them. Nothing will help the man who is off on a spiritual
tangent so much as the wife who adopts a sane spiritual program, making
a better practical use of it.

There will be other profound changes in the household. Liquor
incapacitated father for so many years that mother became head of the
house. She met these responsibilities gallantly. By force of
circumstances, she was often obliged to treat father as a sick or
wayward child. Even when he wanted to assert himself he could not, for
his drinking placed him constantly in the wrong. Mother made all the
plans and gave the directions. When sober, father usually obeyed. Thus
mother, through no fault of her own, became accustomed to wearing the
family trousers. Father, coming suddenly to life again, often begins to
assert himself. This means trouble, unless the family watches for these
tendencies in each other and comes to a friendly agreement about them.

Drinking isolates most homes from the outside world. Father may have
laid aside for years all normal activities-clubs, civic duties, sports.
When he renews interest in such things, a feeling of jealousy may arise.
The family may feel they hold a mortgage on dad, so big that no equity
should be left for outsiders. Instead of developing new channels of
activity for themselves, mother and children demand that he stay home
and make up the deficiency.

At the very beginning, the couple ought to frankly face the fact that
each will have to yield here and there if the family is going to play an
effective part in the new life. Father will necessarily spend much time
with other alcoholics, but this activity should be balanced. New
acquaintances who know nothing of alcoholism might be made and
thoughtful consideration given their needs. The problems of the
community might engage attention. Though the family has no religious
connections, they may wish to make contact with or take membership in a
religious body.

Alcoholics who have derided religious people will be helped by such
contacts. Being possessed of a spiritual experience, the alcoholic will
find he has much in common with these people, though he may differ with
them on many matters. If he does not argue about religion, he will make
new friends and is sure to find new avenues of usefulness and pleasure.
He and his family can be a bright spot in such congregations. He may
bring new hope and new courage to many a priest, minister, or rabbi, who
gives his all to minister to our troubled world. We intend the foregoing
as a helpful suggestion only. So far as we are concerned, there is
nothing obligatory about it. As non-denominational people, we cannot
make up others' minds for them. Each individual should consult his own
conscience.

We have been speaking to you of serious, sometimes tragic things. We
have been dealing with alcohol in its worst aspect. But we aren't a glum
lot. If newcomers could see no joy or fun in our existence, they
wouldn't want it. We absolutely insist on enjoying life. We try not to
indulge in cynicism over the state of the nations, nor do we carry the
world's troubles on our shoulders. When we see a man sinking into the
mire that is alcoholism, we give him first aid and place what we have at
his disposal. For his sake, we do recount and almost relive the horrors
of our past. But those of us who have tried to shoulder the entire
burden and trouble of others find we are soon overcome by them.

So we think cheerfulness and laughter make for usefulness. Outsiders are
sometimes shocked when we burst into merriment over a seemingly tragic
experience out of the past. But why shouldn't we laugh? We have
recovered, and have been given the power to help others.

Everybody knows that those in bad health, and those who seldom play, do
not laugh much. So let each family play together or separately, as much
as their circumstances warrant. We are sure God wants us to be happy,
joyous, and free. We cannot subscribe to the belief that this life is a
vale of tears, though it once was just that for many of us. But it is
clear that we made our own misery. God didn't do it. Avoid then, the
deliberate manufacture of misery, but if trouble comes, cheerfully
capitalize it as an opportunity to demonstrate His omnipotence.

Now about health: A body badly burned by alcohol does not often recover
overnight nor do twisted thinking and depression vanish in a twinkling.
We are convinced that a spiritual mode of living is a most powerful
health restorative. We, who have recovered from serious drinking, are
miracles of mental health. But we have seen remarkable transformations
in our bodies. Hardly one of our crowd now shows any mark of
dissipation.

But this does not mean that we disregard human health measures. God has
abundantly supplied this world with fine doctors, psychologists, and
practitioners of various kinds. Do not hesitate to take your health
problems to such persons. Most of them give freely of themselves, that
their fellows may enjoy sound minds and bodies. Try to remember that
though God has wrought miracles among us, we should never belittle a
good doctor or psychiatrist. Their services are often indispensable in
treating a newcomer and in following his case afterward.

One of the many doctors who had the opportunity of reading this book in
manuscript form told us that the use of sweets was often helpful, of
course depending upon a doctor's advice. He thought all alcoholics
should constantly have chocolate available for its quick energy value at
times of fatigue. He added that occasionally in the night a vague
craving arose which would be satisfied by candy. Many of us have noticed
a tendency to eat sweets and have found this practice beneficial.

A word about sex relations. Alcohol is so sexually stimulating to some
men that they have over-indulged. Couples are occasionally dismayed to
find that when drinking is stopped the man tends to be impotent. Unless
the reason is understood, there may be an emotional upset. Some of us
had this experience, only to enjoy, in a few months, a finer intimacy
than ever. There should be no hesitancy in consulting a doctor or
psychologist if the condition persists. We do not know of many cases
where this difficulty lasted long.

The alcoholic may find it hard to re-establish friendly relations with
his children. Their young minds were impressionable while he was
drinking. Without saying so, they may cordially hate him for what he has
done to them and to their mother. The children are sometimes dominated
by a pathetic hardness and cynicism. They cannot seem to forgive and
forget. This may hang on for months, long after their mother has
accepted dad's new way of living and thinking.

In time they will see that he is a new man and in their own way they
will let him know it. When this happens, they can be invited to join in
morning meditation and then they can take part in the daily discussion
without rancor or bias. From that point on, progress will be rapid.
Marvelous results often follow such a reunion.

Whether the family goes on a spiritual basis or not, the alcoholic
member has to if he would recover. The others must be convinced of his
new status beyond the shadow of a doubt. Seeing is believing to most
families who have lived with a drinker.

Here is a case in point: One of our friends is a heavy smoker and coffee
drinker. There was no doubt he over-indulged. Seeing this, and meaning
to be helpful, his wife commenced to admonish him about it. He admitted
he was overdoing these things, but frankly said that he was not ready to
stop. His wife is one of those persons who really feels there is
something rather sinful about these commodities, so she nagged, and her
intolerance finally threw him into a fit of anger. He got drunk.

Of course our friend was wrong-dead wrong. He had to painfully admit
that and mend his spiritual fences. Though he is now a most effective
member of Alcoholics Anonymous, he still smokes and drinks coffee, but
neither his wife nor anyone else stands in judgment. She sees she was
wrong to make a burning issue out of such a matter when his more serious
ailments were being rapidly cured.

We have three little mottoes which are apropos. Here they are:

First Things First

Live and Let Live

Easy Does It.

## To Employers

AMONG MANY employers nowadays, we think of one member who has spent much
of his life in the world of big business. He has hired and fired
hundreds of men. He knows the alcoholic as the employer sees him. His
present views ought to prove exceptionally useful to business men
everywhere.

But let him tell you:

I was at one time assistant manager of a corporation department
employing sixty-six hundred men. One day my secretary came in saying
that Mr. B- insisted on speaking with me. I told her to say that I was
not interested. I had warned him several times that he had but one more
chance. Not long afterward he had called me from Hartford on two
successive days, so drunk he could hardly speak. I told him he was
through-finally and forever.

My secretary returned to say that it was not Mr. B- on the phone; it was
Mr. B-'s brother, and he wished to give me a message. I still expected a
plea for clemency, but these words came through the receiver: \"I just
wanted to tell you Paul jumped from a hotel window in Hartford last
Saturday. He left us a note saying you were the best boss he ever had,
and that you were not to blame in any way.\"

Another time, as I opened a letter which lay on my desk, a newspaper
clipping fell out. It was the obituary of one of the best salesmen I
ever had. After two weeks of drinking, he had placed his toe on the
trigger of a loaded shotgun-the barrel was in his mouth. I had
discharged him for drinking six weeks before.

Still another experience: A woman's voice came faintly over long
distance from Virginia. She wanted to know if her husband's company
insurance was still in force. Four days before he had hanged himself in
his woodshed. I had been obliged to discharge him for drinking, though
he was brilliant, alert, and one of the best organizers I have ever
known.

Here were three exceptional men lost to this world because I did not
understand alcoholism as I do now. What irony-I became an alcoholic
myself! And but for the intervention of an understanding person, I might
have followed in their footsteps. My downfall cost the business
community unknown thousands of dollars, for it takes real money to train
a man for an executive position. This kind of waste goes on unabated. We
think the business fabric is shot through with a situation which might
be helped by better understanding all around.

Nearly every modern employer feels a moral responsibility for the
well-being of his help, and he tries to meet these responsibilities.
That he has not always done so for the alcoholic is easily understood.
To him the alcoholic has often seemed a fool of the first magnitude.
Because of the employee's special ability, or of his own strong personal
attachment to him, the employer has sometimes kept such a man at work
long beyond a reasonable period. Some employers have tried every known
remedy. In only a few instances has there been a lack of patience and
tolerance. And we, who have imposed on the best of employers, can
scarcely blame them if they have been short with us.

Here, for instance, is a typical example: An officer of one of the
largest banking institutions in America knows I no longer drink. One day
he told me about an executive of the same bank who, from his
description, was undoubtedly alcoholic. This seemed to me like an
opportunity to be helpful, so I spent two hours talking about
alcoholism, the malady, and described the symptoms and results as well
as I could. His comment was, \"Very interesting. But I'm sure this man
is done drinking. He has just returned from a three-months leave of
absence, has taken a cure, looks fine, and to clinch the matter, the
board of directors told him this was his last chance.\"

The only answer I could make was that if the man followed the usual
pattern, he would go on a bigger bust than ever. I felt this was
inevitable and wondered if the bank was doing the man an injustice. Why
not bring him into contact with some of our alcoholic crowd? He might
have a chance. I pointed out that I had had nothing to drink whatever
for three years, and this in the face of difficulties that would have
made nine out of ten men drink their heads off. Why not at least afford
him an opportunity to hear my story? \"Oh no,\" said my friend, \"this
chap is either through with liquor, or he is minus a job. If he has your
will power and guts, he will make the grade.\"

I wanted to throw up my hands in discouragement, for I saw that I had
failed to help my banker friend understand. He simply could not believe
that his brother-executive suffered from a serious illness. There was
nothing to do but wait.

Presently the man did slip and was fired. Following his discharge, we
contacted him. Without much ado, he accepted the principles and
procedure that had helped us. He is undoubtedly on the road to recovery.
To me, this incident illustrates lack of understanding as to what really
ails the alcoholic, and lack of knowledge as to what part employers
might profitably take in salvaging their sick employees.

If you desire to help it might be well to disregard your own drinking,
or lack of it. Whether you are a hard drinker, a moderate drinker or a
teetotaler, you may have some pretty strong opinions, perhaps
prejudices. Those who drink moderately may be more annoyed with an
alcoholic than a total abstainer would be. Drinking occasionally, and
understanding your own reactions, it is possible for you to become quite
sure of many things which, so far as the alcoholic is concerned, are not
always so. As a moderate drinker, you can take your liquor or leave it
alone. Whenever you want to, you control your drinking. Of an evening,
you can go on a mild bender, get up in the morning, shake your head and
go to business. To you, liquor is no real problem. You cannot see why it
should be to anyone else, save the spineless and stupid.

When dealing with an alcoholic, there may be a natural annoyance that a
man could be so weak, stupid and irresponsible. Even when you understand
the malady better, you may feel this feeling rising.

A look at the alcoholic in your organization is many times illuminating.
Is he not usually brilliant, fast-thinking, imaginative and likeable?
When sober, does he not work hard and have a knack of getting things
done? If he had these qualities and did not drink would he be worth
retaining? Should he have the same consideration as other ailing
employees? Is he worth salvaging? If your decision is yes, whether the
reason be humanitarian or business or both, then the following
suggestions may be helpful.

Can you discard the feeling that you are dealing only with habit, with
stubbornness, or a weak will? If this presents difficulty, re-reading
chapters two and three, where the alcoholic sickness is discussed at
length might be worth while. You, as a business man, want to know the
necessities before considering the result. If you concede that your
employee is ill, can he be forgiven for what he has done in the past?
Can his past absurdities be forgotten? Can it be appreciated that he has
been a victim of crooked thinking, directly caused by the action of
alcohol on his brain?

I well remember the shock I received when a prominent doctor in Chicago
told me of cases where pressure of the spinal fluid actually ruptured
the brain. No wonder an alcoholic is strangely irrational. Who wouldn't
be, with such a fevered brain? Normal drinkers are not so affected, nor
can they understand the aberrations of the alcoholic.

Your man has probably been trying to conceal a number of scrapes,
perhaps pretty messy ones. They may be disgusting. You may be at a loss
to understand how such a seemingly above-board chap could be so
involved. But these scrapes can generally be charged, no matter how bad,
to the abnormal action of alcohol on his mind. When drinking, or getting
over a bout, an alcoholic, sometimes the model of honesty when normal,
will do incredible things. Afterward, his revulsion will be terrible.
Nearly always, these antics indicate nothing more than temporary
conditions.

This is not to say that all alcoholics are honest and upright when not
drinking. Of course that isn't so, and such people often may impose on
you. Seeing your attempt to understand and help, some men will try to
take advantage of your kindness. If you are sure your man does not want
to stop, he may as well be discharged, the sooner the better. You are
not doing him a favor by keeping him on. Firing such an individual may
prove a blessing to him. It may be just the jolt he needs. I know, in my
own particular case, that nothing my company could have done would have
stopped me for, so long as I was able to hold my position, I could not
possibly realize how serious my situation was. Had they fired me first,
and had they then taken steps to see that I was presented with the
solution contained in this book, I might have returned to them six
months later, a well man.

But there are many men who want to stop, and with them you can go far.
Your understanding treatment of their cases will pay dividends.

Perhaps you have such a man in mind. He wants to quit drinking and you
want to help him, even if it be only a matter of good business. You now
know more about alcoholism. You can see that he is mentally and
physically sick. You are willing to overlook his past performances.
Suppose an approach is made something like this:

State that you know about his drinking, and that it must stop. You might
say you appreciate his abilities, would like to keep him, but cannot if
he continues to drink. A firm attitude at this point has helped many of
us.

Next he can be assured that you do not intend to lecture, moralize, or
condemn; that if this was done formerly, it was because of
misunderstanding. If possible express a lack of hard feeling toward him.
At this point, it might be well to explain alcoholism, the illness. Say
that you believe he is a gravely ill person, with this
qualification-being perhaps fatally ill, does he want to get well? You
ask, because many alcoholics, being warped and drugged, do not want to
quit. But does he? Will he take every necessary step, submit to anything
to get well, to stop drinking forever?

If he says yes, does he really mean it, or down inside does he think he
is fooling you, and that after rest and treatment he will be able to get
away with a few drinks now and then? We believe a man should be
thoroughly probed on these points. Be satisfied he is not deceiving
himself or you.

Whether you mention this book is a matter for your discretion. If he
temporizes and still thinks he can ever drink again, even beer, he might
as well be discharged after the next bender which, if an alcoholic, he
is almost certain to have. He should understand that emphatically.
Either you are dealing with a man who can and will get well or you are
not. If not, why waste time with him? This may seem severe, but it is
usually the best course.

After satisfying yourself that your man wants to recover and that he
will go to any extreme to do so, you may suggest a definite course of
action. For most alcoholics who are drinking, or who are just getting
over a spree, a certain amount of physical treatment is desirable, even
imperative. The matter of physical treatment should, of course, be
referred to your own doctor. Whatever the method, its object is to
thoroughly clear mind and body of the effects of alcohol. In competent
hands, this seldom takes long nor is it very expensive. Your man will
fare better if placed in such physical condition that he can think
straight and no longer craves liquor. If you propose such a procedure to
him, it may be necessary to advance the cost of treatment, but we
believe it should be made plain that any expense will later be deducted
from his pay. It is better for him to feel fully responsible.

If your man accepts your offer, it should be pointed out that physical
treatment is but a small part of the picture. Though you are providing
him with the best possible medical attention, he should understand that
he must undergo a change of heart. To get over drinking will require a
transformation of thought and attitude. We all had to place recovery
above everything, for without recovery we would have lost both home and
business.

Can you have every confidence in his ability to recover? While on the
subject of confidence, can you adopt the attitude that so far as you are
concerned this will be a strictly personal matter, that his alcoholic
derelictions, the treatment about to be undertaken, will never be
discussed without his consent? It might be well to have a long chat with
him on his return.

To return to the subject matter of this book: It contains full
suggestions by which the employee may solve his problem. To you, some of
the ideas which it contains are novel. Perhaps you are not quite in
sympathy with the approach we suggest. By no means do we offer it as the
last word on this subject, but so far as we are concerned, it has worked
with us. After all, are you not looking for results rather than methods?
Whether your employee likes it or not, he will learn the grim truth
about alcoholism. That won't hurt him a bit, even though he does not go
for this remedy.

We suggest you draw the book to the attention of the doctor who is to
attend your patient during treatment. If the book is read the moment the
patient is able, while acutely depressed, realization of his condition
may come to him.

We hope the doctor will tell the patient the truth about his condition,
whatever that happens to be. When the man is presented with this volume
it is best that no one tell him he must abide by its suggestions. The
man must decide for himself.

You are betting, of course, that your changed attitude plus the contents
of this book will turn the trick. In some cases it will, and in others
it may not. But we think that if you persevere, the percentage of
successes will gratify you. As our work spreads and our numbers
increase, we hope your employees may be put in personal contact with
some of us. Meanwhile, we are sure a great deal can be accomplished by
the use of the book alone.

On your employee's return, talk with him. Ask him if he thinks he has
the answer. If he feels free to discuss his problems with you, if he
knows you under-stand and will not be upset by anything he wishes to
say, he will probably be off to a fast start.

In this connection, can you remain undisturbed if the man proceeds to
tell you shocking things? He may, for example, reveal that he has padded
his expense account or that he has planned to take your best customers
away from you. In fact, he may say almost anything if he has accepted
our solution which, as you know, demands rigorous honesty. Can you
charge this off as you would a bad account and start fresh with him? If
he owes you money you may wish to make terms.

If he speaks of his home situation, you can undoubtedly make helpful
suggestions. Can he talk frankly with you so long as he does not bear
business tales or criticize his associates? With this kind of employee
such an attitude will command undying loyalty.

The greatest enemies of us alcoholics are resentment, jealousy, envy,
frustration, and fear. Wherever men are gathered together in business
there will be rivalries and, arising out of these, a certain amount of
office politics. Sometimes we alcoholics have an idea that people are
trying to pull us down. Often this is not so at all. But sometimes our
drinking will be used politically.

One instance comes to mind in which a malicious individual was always
making friendly little jokes about an alcoholic's drinking exploits. In
this way he was slyly carrying tales. In another case, an alcoholic was
sent to a hospital for treatment. Only a few knew of it at first but,
within a short time, it was billboarded throughout the entire company.
Naturally this sort of thing decreased the man's chance of recovery. The
employer can many times protect the victim from this kind of talk. The
employer cannot play favorites, but he can always defend a man from
needless provocation and unfair criticism.

As a class, alcoholics are energetic people. They work hard and they
play hard. Your man should be on his mettle to make good. Being somewhat
weakened, and faced with physical and mental readjustment to a life
which knows no alcohol, he may overdo. You may have to curb his desire
to work sixteen hours a day. You may need to encourage him to play once
in a while. He may wish to do a lot for other alcoholics and something
of the sort may come up during business hours. A reasonable amount of
latitude will be helpful. This work is necessary to maintain his
sobriety.

After your man has gone along without drinking for a few months, you may
be able to make use of his services with other employees who are giving
you the alcoholic run-around-provided, of course, they are willing to
have a third party in the picture. An alcoholic who has recovered, but
holds a relatively unimportant job, can talk to a man with a better
position. Being on a radically different basis of life, he will never
take advantage of the situation.

Your man may be trusted. Long experience with alcoholic excuses
naturally arouses suspicion. When his wife next calls saying he is sick,
you might jump to the conclusion he is drunk. If he is, and is still
trying to recover, he will tell you about it even if it means the loss
of his job. For he knows he must be honest if he would live at all. He
will appreciate knowing you are not bothering your head about him, that
you are not suspicious nor are you trying to run his life so he will be
shielded from temptation to drink. If he is conscientiously following
the program of recovery he can go anywhere your business may call him.

In case he does stumble, even once, you will have to decide whether to
let him go. If you are sure he doesn't mean business, there is no doubt
you should discharge him. If, on the contrary, you are sure he is doing
his utmost, you may wish to give him another chance. But you should feel
under no obligation to keep him on, for your obligation has been well
discharged already.

There is another thing you might wish to do. If your organization is a
large one, your junior executives might be provided with this book. You
might let them know you have no quarrel with the alcoholics of your
organization. These juniors are often in a difficult position. Men under
them are frequently their friends. So, for one reason or another, they
cover these men, hoping matters will take a turn for the better. They
often jeopardize their own positions by trying to help serious drinkers
who should have been fired long ago, or else given an opportunity to get
well.

After reading this book, a junior executive can go to such a man and say
approximately this, \"Look here, Ed. Do you want to stop drinking or
not? You put me on the spot every time you get drunk. It isn't fair to
me or the firm. I have been learning something about alcoholism. If you
are an alcoholic, you are a mighty sick man. You act like one. The firm
wants to help you get over it, and if you are interested, there is a way
out. If you take it, your past will be forgotten and the fact that you
went away for treatment will not be mentioned. But if you cannot or will
not stop drinking, I think you ought to resign.\"

Your junior executive may not agree with the contents of our book. He
need not, and often should not show it to his alcoholic prospect. But at
least he will understand the problem and will no longer be misled by
ordinary promises. He will be able to take a position with such a man
which is eminently fair and square. He will have no further reason for
covering up an alcoholic employee.

It boils right down to this: No man should be fired just because he is
alcoholic. If he wants to stop, he should be afforded a real chance. If
he cannot or does not want to stop, he should be discharged. The
exceptions are few.

We think this method of approach will accomplish several things. It will
permit the rehabilitation of good men. At the same time you will feel no
reluctance to rid yourself of those who cannot or will not stop.
Alcoholism may be causing your organization considerable damage in its
waste of time, men and reputation. We hope our suggestions will help you
plug up this sometimes serious leak. We think we are sensible when we
urge that you stop this waste and give your worthwhile man a chance.

The other day an approach was made to the vice president of a large
industrial concern. He remarked: \"I'm mighty glad you fellows got over
your drinking. But the policy of this company is not to interfere with
the habits of our employees. If a man drinks so much that his job
suffers, we fire him. I don't see how you can be of any help to us for,
as you see, we don't have any alcoholic problem.\" This same company
spends millions for research every year. Their cost of production is
figured to a fine decimal point. They have recreational facilities.
There is company insurance. There is a real interest, both humanitarian
and business, in the well-being of employees. But alcoholism-well, they
just don't believe they have it.

Perhaps this is a typical attitude. We, who have collectively seen a
great deal of business life, at least from the alcoholic angle, had to
smile at this gentleman's sincere opinion. He might be shocked if he
knew how much alcoholism is costing his organization a year. That
company may harbor many actual or potential alcoholics. We believe that
managers of large enterprises often have little idea how prevalent this
problem is. Even if you feel your organization has no alcoholic problem,
it might pay to take another look down the line. You may make some
interesting discoveries.

Of course, this chapter refers to alcoholics, sick people, deranged men.
What our friend, the vice president, had in mind was the habitual or
whoopee drinker. As to them, his policy is undoubtedly sound, but he did
not distinguish between such people and the alcoholic.

It is not to be expected that an alcoholic employee will receive a
disproportionate amount of time and attention. He should not be made a
favorite. The right kind of man, the kind who recovers, will not want
this sort of thing. He will not impose. Far from it. He will work like
the devil and thank you to his dying day.

Today I own a little company. There are two alcoholic employees, who
produce as much as five normal salesmen. But why not? They have a new
attitude, and they have been saved from a living death. I have enjoyed
every moment spent in getting them straightened out.

## A Vision For You

FOR MOST normal folks, drinking means conviviality, companionship and
colorful imagination. It means release from care, boredom and worry. It
is joyous intimacy with friends and a feeling that life is good. But not
so with us in those last days of heavy drinking. The old pleasures were
gone. They were but memories. Never could we recapture the great moments
of the past. There was an insistent yearning to enjoy life as we once
did and a heartbreaking obsession that some new miracle of control would
enable us to do it. There was always one more attempt-and one more
failure.

The less people tolerated us, the more we withdrew from society, from
life itself. As we became subjects of King Alcohol, shivering denizens
of his mad realm, the chilling vapor that is loneliness settled down. It
thickened, ever becoming blacker. Some of us sought out sordid places,
hoping to find understanding companionship and approval. Momentarily we
did-then would come oblivion and the awful awakening to face the hideous
Four Horsemen-Terror, Bewilderment, Frustration, Despair. Unhappy
drinkers who read this page will understand!

Now and then a serious drinker, being dry at the moment says, \"I don't
miss it at all. Feel better. Work better. Having a better time.\" As
ex-problem drinkers, we smile at such a sally. We know our friend is
like a boy whistling in the dark to keep up his spirits. He fools
himself. Inwardly he would give anything to take half a dozen drinks and
get away with them. He will presently try the old game again, for he
isn't happy about his sobriety. He cannot picture life without alcohol.
Some day he will be unable to imagine life either with alcohol or
without it. Then he will know loneliness such as few do. He will be at
the jumping-off place. He will wish for the end.

We have shown how we got out from under. You say, \"Yes, I'm willing.
But am I to be consigned to a life where I shall be stupid, boring and
glum, like some righteous people I see? I know I must get along without
liquor, but how can I? Have you a sufficient substitute?\"

Yes, there is a substitute and it is vastly more than that. It is a
fellowship in Alcoholics Anonymous. There you will find release from
care, boredom and worry. Your imagination will be fired. Life will mean
something at last. The most satisfactory years of your existence lie
ahead. Thus we find the fellowship, and so will you.

\"How is that to come about?\" you ask. \"Where am I to find these
people?\"

You are going to meet these new friends in your own community. Near you,
alcoholics are dying helplessly like people in a sinking ship. If you
live in a large place, there are hundreds. High and low, rich and poor,
these are future fellows of Alcoholics Anonymous. Among them you will
make lifelong friends. You will be bound to them with new and wonderful
ties, for you will escape disaster together and you will commence
shoulder to shoulder your common journey. Then you will know what it
means to give of yourself that others may survive and rediscover life.
You will learn the full meaning of \"Love thy neighbor as thyself.\"

It may seem incredible that these men are to become happy, respected,
and useful once more. How can they rise out of such misery, bad repute
and hopelessness? The practical answer is that since these things have
happened among us, they can happen with you. Should you wish them above
all else, and be willing to make use of our experience, we are sure they
will come. The age of miracles is still with us. Our own recovery proves
that!

Our hope is that when this chip of a book is launched on the world tide
of alcoholism, defeated drinkers will seize upon it, to follow its
suggestions. Many, we are sure, will rise to their feet and march on.
They will approach still other sick ones and fellowships of Alcoholics
Anonymous may spring up in each city and hamlet, havens for those who
must find a way out.

In the chapter \"Working With Others\" you gathered an idea of how we
approach and aid others to health. Suppose now that through you several
families have adopted this way of life. You will want to know more of
how to proceed from that point. Perhaps the best way of treating you to
a glimpse of your future will be to describe the growth of the
fellowship among us. Here is a brief account:

Years ago, in 1935, one of our number made a journey to a certain
western city. From a business standpoint, his trip came off badly. Had
he been successful in his enterprise, he would have been set on his feet
financially which, at the time, seemed vitally important. But his
venture wound up in a law suit and bogged down completely. The
proceeding was shot through with much hard feeling and controversy.

Bitterly discouraged, he found himself in a strange place, discredited
and almost broke. Still physically weak, and sober but a few months, he
saw that his predicament was dangerous. He wanted so much to talk with
someone, but whom?

One dismal afternoon he paced a hotel lobby wondering how his bill was
to be paid. At one end of the room stood a glass covered directory of
local churches. Down the lobby a door opened into an attractive bar. He
could see the gay crowd inside. In there he would find companionship and
release. Unless he took some drinks, he might not have the courage to
scrape an acquaintance and would have a lonely week-end.

Of course he couldn't drink, but why not sit hopefully at a table, a
bottle of ginger ale before him? After all, had he not been sober six
months now? Perhaps he could handle, say, three drinks-no more! Fear
gripped him. He was on thin ice. Again it was the old, insidious
insanity-that first drink. With a shiver, he turned away and walked down
the lobby to the church directory. Music and gay chatter still floated
to him from the bar.

But what about his responsibilities-his family and the men who would die
because they would not know how to get well, ah-yes, those other
alcoholics? There must be many such in this town. He would phone a
clergyman. His sanity returned and he thanked God. Selecting a church at
random from the directory, he stepped into a booth and lifted the
receiver.

His call to the clergyman led him presently to a certain resident of the
town, who, though formerly able and respected, was then nearing the
nadir of alcoholic despair. It was the usual situation: home in
jeopardy, wife ill, children distracted, bills in arrears and standing
damaged. He had a desperate desire to stop, but saw no way out, for he
had earnestly tried many avenues of escape. Painfully aware of being
somehow abnormal, the man did not fully realize what it meant to be
alcoholic.

When our friend related his experience, the man agreed that no amount of
will power he might muster could stop his drinking for long. A spiritual
experience, he conceded, was absolutely necessary, but the price seemed
high upon the basis suggested. He told how he lived in constant worry
about those who might find out about his alcoholism. He had, of course,
the familiar alcoholic obsession that few knew of his drinking. Why, he
argued, should he lose the remainder of his business, only to bring
still more suffering to his family by foolishly admitting his plight to
people from whom he made his livelihood? He would do anything, he said,
but that.

Being intrigued, however, he invited our friend to his home. Some time
later, and just as he thought he was getting control of his liquor
situation, he went on a roaring bender. For him, this was the spree that
ended all sprees. He saw that he would have to face his problems
squarely that God might give him mastery.

One morning he took the bull by the horns and set out to tell those he
feared what his trouble had been. He found himself surprisingly well
received, and learned that many knew of his drinking. Stepping into his
car, he made the rounds of people he had hurt. He trembled as he went
about, for this might mean ruin, particularly to a person in his line of
business.

At midnight he came home exhausted, but very happy. He has not had a
drink since. As we shall see, he now means a great deal to his
community, and the major liabilities of thirty years of hard drinking
have been repaired in four.

But life was not easy for the two friends. Plenty of difficulties
presented themselves. Both saw that they must keep spiritually active.
One day they called up the head nurse of a local hospital. They
explained their need and inquired if she had a first class alcoholic
prospect.

She replied, \"Yes, we've got a corker. He's just beaten up a couple of
nurses. Goes off his head completely when he's drinking. But he's a
grand chap when he's sober, though he's been in here eight times in the
last six months. Understand he was once a well-known lawyer in town, but
just now we've got him strapped down tight.\"

Here was a prospect all right but, by the description, none too
promising. The use of spiritual principles in such cases was not so well
understood as it is now. But one of the friends said, \"Put him in a
private room. We'll be down.\"

Two days later, a future fellow of Alcoholics Anonymous stared glassily
at the strangers beside his bed. \"Who are you fellows, and why this
private room? I was always in a ward before.\"

Said one of the visitors, \"We're giving you a treatment for
alcoholism.\"

Hopelessness was written large on the man's face as he replied, \"Oh,
but that's no use. Nothing would fix me. I'm a goner. The last three
times, I got drunk on the way home from here. I'm afraid to go out the
door. I can't understand it.\"

For an hour, the two friends told him about their drinking experiences.
Over and over, he would say: \"That's me. That's me. I drink like
that.\"

The man in the bed was told of the acute poisoning from which he
suffered, how it deteriorates the body of an alcoholic and warps his
mind. There was much talk about the mental state preceding the first
drink.

\"Yes, that's me,\" said the sick man, \"the very image. You fellows
know your stuff all right, but I don't see what good it'll do. You
fellows are somebody. I was once, but I'm a nobody now. From what you
tell me, I know more than ever I can't stop.\" At this both the visitors
burst into a laugh. Said the future Fellow Anonymous: \"Damn little to
laugh about that I can see.\"

The two friends spoke of their spiritual experience and told him about
the course of action they carried out.

He interrupted: \"I used to be strong for the church, but that won't fix
it. I've prayed to God on hangover mornings and sworn that I'd never
touch another drop but by nine o'clock I'd be boiled as an owl.\"

Next day found the prospect more receptive. He had been thinking it
over. \"Maybe you're right,\" he said. \"God ought to be able to do
anything.\" Then he added, \"He sure didn't do much for me when I was
trying to fight this booze racket alone.\"

On the third day the lawyer gave his life to the care and direction of
his Creator, and said he was perfectly willing to do anything necessary.
His wife came, scarcely daring to be hopeful, though she thought she saw
something different about her husband already. He had begun to have a
spiritual experience.

That afternoon he put on his clothes and walked from the hospital a free
man. He entered a political campaign, making speeches, frequenting men's
gathering places of all sorts, often staying up all night. He lost the
race by only a narrow margin. But he had found God-and in finding God
had found himself.

That was in June, 1935. He never drank again. He too, has become a
respected and useful member of his community. He has helped other men
recover, and is a power in the church from which he was long absent.

So, you see, there were three alcoholics in that town, who now felt they
had to give to others what they had found, or be sunk. After several
failures to find others, a fourth turned up. He came through an
acquaintance who had heard the good news. He proved to be a
devil-may-care young fellow whose parents could not make out whether he
wanted to stop drinking or not. They were deeply religious people, much
shocked by their son's refusal to have anything to do with the church.
He suffered horribly from his sprees, but it seemed as if nothing could
be done for him. He consented, however, to go to the hospital, where he
occupied the very room recently vacated by the lawyer.

He had three visitors. After a bit, he said, \"The way you fellows put
this spiritual stuff makes sense. I'm ready to do business. I guess the
old folks were right after all.\" So one more was added to the
Fellowship.

All this time our friend of the hotel lobby incident remained in that
town. He was there three months. He now returned home, leaving behind
his first acquaintance, the lawyer and the devil-may-care chap. These
men had found something brand new in life. Though they knew they must
help other alcoholics if they would remain sober, that motive became
secondary. It was transcended by the happiness they found in giving
themselves for others. They shared their homes, their slender resources,
and gladly devoted their spare hours to fellow-sufferers. They were
willing, by day or night, to place a new man in the hospital and visit
him afterward. They grew in numbers. They experienced a few distressing
failures, but in those cases they made an effort to bring the man's
family into a spiritual way of living, thus relieving much worry and
suffering.

A year and six months later these three had succeeded with seven more.
Seeing much of each other, scarce an evening passed that someone's home
did not shelter a little gathering of men and women, happy in their
release, and constantly thinking how they might present their discovery
to some newcomer. In addition to these casual get-togethers, it became
customary to set apart one night a week for a meeting to be attended by
anyone or everyone interested in a spiritual way of life. Aside from
fellowship and sociability, the prime object was to provide a time and
place where new people might bring their problems.

Outsiders became interested. One man and his wife placed their large
home at the disposal of this strangely assorted crowd. This couple has
since become so fascinated that they have dedicated their home to the
work. Many a distracted wife has visited this house to find loving and
understanding companionship among women who knew her problem, to hear
from the lips of their husbands what had happened to them, to be advised
how her own wayward mate might be hospitalized and approached when next
he stumbled.

Many a man, yet dazed from his hospital experience, has stepped over the
threshold of that home into freedom. Many an alcoholic who entered there
came away with an answer. He succumbed to that gay crowd inside, who
laughed at their own misfortunes and understood his. Impressed by those
who visited him at the hospital, he capitulated entirely when, later, in
an upper room of this house, he heard the story of some man whose
experience closely tallied with his own. The expression on the faces of
the women, that indefinable something in the eyes of the men, the
stimulating and electric atmosphere of the place, conspired to let him
know that here was haven at last.

The very practical approach to his problems, the absence of intolerance
of any kind, the informality, the genuine democracy, the uncanny
understanding which these people had were irresistible. He and his wife
would leave elated by the thought of what they could now do for some
stricken acquaintance and his family. They knew they had a host of new
friends; it seemed they had known these strangers always. They had seen
miracles, and one was to come to them. They had visioned the Great
Reality-their loving and All Powerful Creator.

Now, this house will hardly accommodate its weekly visitors, for they
number sixty or eighty as a rule. Alcoholics are being attracted from
far and near. From surrounding towns, families drive long distances to
be present. A community thirty miles away has fifteen fellows of
Alcoholics Anonymous. Being a large place, we think that some day its
Fellowship will number many hundreds.

But life among Alcoholics Anonymous is more than attending gatherings
and visiting hospitals. Cleaning up old scrapes, helping to settle
family differences, explaining the disinherited son to his irate
parents, lending money and securing jobs for each other, when
justified-these are everyday occurrences. No one is too discredited or
has sunk too low to be welcomed cordially-if he means business. Social
distinctions, petty rivalries and jealousies-these are laughed out of
countenance. Being wrecked in the same vessel, being restored and united
under one God, with hearts and minds attuned to the welfare of others,
the things which matter so much to some people no longer signify much to
them. How could they?

Under only slightly different conditions, the same thing is taking place
in many eastern cities. In one of these there is a well-known hospital
for the treatment of alcoholic and drug addiction. Six years ago one of
our number was a patient there. Many of us have felt, for the first
time, the Presence and Power of God within its walls. We are greatly
indebted to the doctor in attendance there, for he, although it might
prejudice his own work, has told us of his belief in ours.

Every few days this doctor suggests our approach to one of his patients.
Understanding our work, he can do this with an eye to selecting those
who are willing and able to recover on a spiritual basis. Many of us,
former patients, go there to help. Then, in this eastern city, there are
informal meetings such as we have described to you, where you may now
see scores of members. There are the same fast friendships, there is the
same helpfulness to one another as you find among our western friends.
There is a good bit of travel between East and West and we foresee a
great increase in this helpful interchange.

Some day we hope that every alcoholic who journeys will find a
Fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous at his destination. To some extent
this is already true. Some of us are salesmen and go about. Little
clusters of twos and threes and fives of us have sprung up in other
communities, through contact with our two larger centers. Those of us
who travel drop in as often as we can. This practice enables us to lend
a hand, at the same time avoiding certain alluring distractions of the
road, about which any traveling man can inform you.

Thus we grow. And so can you, though you be but one man with this book
in your hand. We believe and hope it contains all you will need to
begin.

We know what you are thinking. You are saying to yourself: \"I'm jittery
and alone. I couldn't do that.\" But you can. You forget that you have
just now tapped a source of power much greater than yourself. To
duplicate, with such backing, what we have accomplished is only a matter
of willingness, patience and labor.

We know of an A.A. member who was living in a large community. He had
lived there but a few weeks when he found that the place probably
contained more alcoholics per square mile than any city in the country.
This was only a few days ago at this writing. (1939) The authorities
were much concerned. He got in touch with a prominent psychiatrist who
had undertaken certain responsibilities for the mental health of the
community. The doctor proved to be able and exceedingly anxious to adopt
any workable method of handling the situation. So he inquired, what did
our friend have on the ball?

Our friend proceeded to tell him. And with such good effect that the
doctor agreed to a test among his patients and certain other alcoholics
from a clinic which he attends. Arrangements were also made with the
chief psychiatrist of a large public hospital to select still others
from the stream of misery which flows through that institution.

So our fellow worker will soon have friends galore. Some of them may
sink and perhaps never get up, but if our experience is a criterion,
more than half of those approached will become fellows of Alcoholics
Anonymous. When a few men in this city have found themselves, and have
discovered the joy of helping others to face life again, there will be
no stopping until everyone in that town has had his opportunity to
recover-if he can and will.

Still you may say: \"But I will not have the benefit of contact with you
who write this book.\" We cannot be sure. God will determine that, so
you must remember that your real reliance is always upon Him. He will
show you how to create the fellowship you crave.

Our book is meant to be suggestive only. We realize we know only a
little. God will constantly disclose more to you and to us. Ask Him in
your morning meditation what you can do each day for the man who is
still sick. The answers will come, if your own house is in order. But
obviously you cannot transmit something you haven't got. See to it that
your relationship with Him is right, and great events will come to pass
for you and countless others. This is the Great Fact for us.

Abandon yourself to God as you understand God. Admit your faults to Him
and to your fellows. Clear away the wreckage of your past. Give freely
of what you find and join us. We shall be with you in the Fellowship of
the Spirit, and you will surely meet some of us as you trudge the Road
of Happy Destiny.

May God bless you and keep you-until then.


## Doctor Bob's Nightmare

A Co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. The birth of our Society dates
from his first day of permanent sobriety, June 10, 1935.

To 1950, the year of his death, he carried the A.A. message to more than
5,000 alcoholic men and women, and to all these he gave his medical
services without thought of charge.

In this prodigy of service, he was well assisted by Sister Ignatia at
St. Thomas Hospital in Akron, Ohio, one of the greatest friends our
Fellowship will ever know.

I WAS born in a small New England village of about seven thousand souls.
The general moral standard was, as I recall it, far above the average.
No beer or liquor was sold in the neighborhood, except at the State
liquor agency where perhaps one might procure a pint if he could
convince the agent that he really needed it. Without this proof the
expectant purchaser would be forced to depart empty handed with none of
what I later came to believe was the great panacea for all human ills.
Men who had liquor shipped in from Boston or New York by express were
looked upon with great distrust and disfavor by most of the good
townspeople. The town was well supplied with churches and schools in
which I pursued my early educational activities.

My father was a professional man of recognized ability and both my
father and mother were most active in church affairs. Both father and
mother were considerably above the average in intelligence.

Unfortunately for me I was the only child, which perhaps engendered the
selfishness which played such an important part in bringing on my
alcoholism.

From childhood through high school I was more or less forced to go to
church, Sunday School and evening service, Monday night Christian
Endeavor and sometimes to Wednesday evening prayer meeting. This had the
effect of making me resolve that when I was free from parental
domination, I would never again darken the doors of a church. This
resolution I kept steadfastly for the next forty years, except when
circumstances made it seem unwise to absent myself.

After high school came four years in one of the best colleges in the
country where drinking seemed to be a major extra-curricular activity.
Almost everyone seemed to do it. I did it more and more, and had lots of
fun without much grief, either physical or financial. I seemed to be
able to snap back the next morning better than most of my fellow
drinkers, who were cursed (or perhaps blessed) with a great deal of
morning-after nausea. Never once in my life have I had a headache, which
fact leads me to believe that I was an alcoholic almost from the start.
My whole life seemed to be centered around doing what I wanted to do,
without regard for the rights, wishes, or privileges of anyone else; a
state of mind which became more and more predominant as the years
passed. I was graduated with "summa cum laude" in the eyes of the
drinking fraternity, but not in the eyes of the Dean.

The next three years I spent in Boston, Chicago, and Montreal in the
employ of a large manufacturing con-

cern, selling railway supplies, gas engines of all sorts, and many other
items of heavy hardware. During these years, I drank as much as my purse
permitted, still without paying too great a penalty, although I was
beginning to have morning jitters at times. I lost only a half day's
work during these three years.

My next move was to take up the study of medicine, entering one of the
largest universities in the country. There I took up the business of
drinking with much greater earnestness than I had previously shown. On
account of my enormous capacity for beer, I was elected to membership in
one of the drinking societies, and soon became one of the leading
spirits. Many mornings I have gone to classes, and even though fully
prepared, would turn and walk back to the fraternity house because of my
jitters, not daring to enter the classroom for fear of making a scene
should I be called on for recitation.

This went from bad to worse until Sophomore spring when, after a
prolonged period of drinking, I made up my mind that I could not
complete my course, so I packed my grip and went South and spent a month
on a large farm owned by a friend of mine. When I got the fog out of my
brain, I decided that quitting school was very foolish and that I had
better return and continue my work. When I reached school, I discovered
the faculty had other ideas on the subject. After much argument they
allowed me to return and take my exams, all of which I passed
creditably. But they were much disgusted and told me they would attempt
to struggle along without my presence. After many painful discussions,
they finally gave me my credits and I

migrated to another of the leading universities of the country and
entered as a Junior that Fall.

There my drinking became so much worse that the boys in the fraternity
house where I lived felt forced to send for my father, who made a long
journey in the vain endeavor to get me straightened around. This had
little effect however for I kept on drinking and used a great deal more
hard liquor than in former years.

Coming up to final exams I went on a particularly strenuous spree. When
I went in to write the examinations, my hand trembled so I could not
hold a pencil. I passed in at least three absolutely blank books. I was,
of course, soon on the carpet and the upshot was that I had to go back
for two more quarters and remain absolutely dry, if I wished to
graduate. This I did, and proved myself satisfactory to the faculty,
both in deportment and scholastically.

I conducted myself so creditably that I was able to secure a much
coveted internship in a western city, where I spent two years. During
these two years I was kept so busy that I hardly left the hospital at
all. Consequently, I could not get into any trouble.

When those two years were up, I opened an office downtown. Then I had
some money, all the time in the world, and considerable stomach trouble.
I soon discovered that a couple of drinks would alleviate my gastric
distress, at least for a few hours at a time, so it was not at all
difficult for me to return to my former excessive indulgence.

By this time I was beginning to pay very dearly physically and, in hope
of relief, voluntarily incarcerated myself at least a dozen times in one
of the

local sanitariums. I was between Scylla and Charybdis now, because if I
did not drink my stomach tortured me, and if I did, my nerves did the
same thing. After three years of this, I wound up in the local hospital
where they attempted to help me, but I would get my friends to smuggle
me a quart, or I would steal the alcohol about the building, so that I
got rapidly worse.

Finally my father had to send a doctor out from my home town who managed
to get me back there some way and I was in bed about two months before I
could venture out of the house. I stayed about town a couple of months
more and returned to resume my practice. I think I must have been
thoroughly scared by what had happened, or by the doctor, or probably
both, so that I did not touch a drink again until the country went dry.

With the passing of the Eighteenth Amendment I felt quite safe. I knew
everyone would buy a few bottles, or cases, of liquor as their
exchequers permitted, and it would soon be gone. Therefore it would make
no great difference, even if I should do some drinking. At that time I
was not aware of the almost unlimited supply the government made it
possible for us doctors to obtain, neither had I any knowledge of the
bootlegger who soon appeared on the horizon. I drank with moderation at
first, but it took me only a relatively short time to drift back into
the old habits which had wound up so disastrously before.

During the next few years, I developed two distinct phobias. One was the
fear of not sleeping, and the other was the fear of running out of
liquor. Not being

a man of means, I knew that if I did not stay sober enough to earn
money, I would run out of liquor. Most of the time, therefore, I did not
take the morning drink which I craved so badly, but instead would fill
up on large doses of sedatives to quiet the jitters, which distressed me
terribly. Occasionally, I would yield to the morning craving, but if I
did, it would be only a few hours before I would be quite unfit for
work. This would lessen my chances of smuggling some home that evening,
which in turn would mean a night of futile tossing around in bed
followed by a morning of unbearable jitters. During the subsequent
fifteen years I had sense enough never to go to the hospital if I had
been drinking, and very seldom did I receive patients. I would sometimes
hide out in one of the clubs of which I was a member, and had the habit
at times of registering at a hotel under a fictitious name. But my
friends usually found me and I would go home if they promised that I
should not be scolded.

If my wife were planning to go out in the afternoon, I would get a large
supply of liquor and smuggle it home and hide it in the coal bin, the
clothes chute, over door jambs, over beams in the cellar and in cracks
in the cellar tile. I also made use of old trunks and chests, the old
can container, and even the ash container. The water tank on the toilet
I never used, because that looked too easy. I found out later that my
wife inspected it frequently. I used to put eight or twelve ounce
bottles of alcohol in a fur lined glove and toss it onto the back airing
porch when winter days got dark enough. My bootlegger had hidden alcohol
at the back steps where I could get it at my convenience. Sometimes I
would bring it in my

pockets, but they were inspected, and that became too risky. I used also
to put it up in four ounce bottles and stick several in my stocking
tops. This worked nicely until my wife and I went to see Wallace Beery
in "Tugboat Annie," after which the pant-leg and stocking racket were
out!

I will not take space to relate all my hospital or sanitarium
experiences.

During all this time we became more or less ostracized by our friends.
We could not be invited out because I would surely get tight and my wife
dared not invite people in for the same reason. My phobia for
sleeplessness demanded that I get drunk every night, but in order to get
more liquor for the next night, I had to stay sober during the day, at
least up to four o' clock. This routine went on with few interruptions
for seventeen years. It was really a horrible nightmare, this earning
money, getting liquor, smuggling it home, getting drunk, morning
jitters, taking large doses of sedatives to make it possible for me to
earn more money, and so on ad nauseam. I used to promise my wife, my
friends, and my children that I would drink no more---promises which
seldom kept me sober even through the day, though I was very sincere
when I made them.

For the benefit of those experimentally inclined, I should mention the
so-called beer experiment. When beer first came back, I thought that I
was safe. I could drink all I wanted of that. It was harmless; nobody
ever got drunk on beer. So I filled the cellar full, with the permission
of my good wife. It was not long before I was drinking at least a case
and a half a day. I put on thirty pounds weight in about two

months, looked like a pig, and was uncomfortable from shortness of
breath. It then occurred to me that after one was all smelled up with
beer nobody could tell what had been drunk, so I began to fortify my
beer with straight alcohol. Of course, the result was very bad, and that
ended the beer experiment.

About the time of the beer experiment I was thrown in with a crowd of
people who attracted me because of their seeming poise, health, and
happiness. They spoke with great freedom from embarrassment, which I
could never do, and they seemed very much at ease on all occasions and
appeared very healthy. More than these attributes, they seemed to be
happy. I was self conscious and ill at ease most of the time, my health
was at the breaking point, and I was thoroughly miserable. I sensed they
had something I did not have, from which I might readily profit. I
learned that it was something of a spiritual nature, which did not
appeal to me very much, but I thought it could do no harm. I gave the
matter much time and study for the next two and a half years, but still
got tight every night nevertheless. I read everything I could find, and
talked to everyone who I thought knew anything about it.

My wife became deeply interested and it was her interest that sustained
mine, though I at no time sensed that it might be an answer to my liquor
problem. How my wife kept her faith and courage during all those years,
I'll never know, but she did. If she had not, I know I would have been
dead a long time ago. For some reason, we alcoholics seem to have the
gift of picking out the world's finest women. Why they

should be subjected to the tortures we inflicted upon them, I cannot
explain.

About this time a lady called up my wife one Saturday afternoon, saying
she wanted me to come over that evening to meet a friend of hers who
might help me. It was the day before Mother's Day and I had come home
plastered, carrying a big potted plant which I set down on the table and
forthwith went upstairs and passed out. The next day she called again.
Wishing to be polite, though I felt very badly, I said, "Let's make the
call," and extracted from my wife a promise that we would not stay over
fifteen minutes.

We entered her house at exactly five o' clock and it was eleven fifteen
when we left. I had a couple of shorter talks with this man afterward,
and stopped drinking abruptly. This dry spell lasted for about three
weeks; Then I went to Atlantic City to attend several days' meeting of a
National Society of which I was a member. I drank all the Scotch they
had on the train and bought several quarts on my way to the hotel. This
was on Sunday. I got tight that night, stayed sober Monday till after
the dinner and then proceeded to get tight again. I drank all I dared in
the bar, and then went to my room to finish the job. Tuesday I started
in the morning, getting well organized by noon. I did not want to
disgrace myself, so I then checked out. I bought some more liquor on the
way to the depot. I had to wait some time for the train. I remember
nothing from then on until I woke up at a friend's house, in a town near
home. These good people notified my wife, who sent my newly-made friend
over to get me. He came and got me home and to bed, gave

me a few drinks that night, and one bottle of beer the next morning.

That was June 10, 1935, and that was my last drink. As I write nearly
six years have passed.

The question which might naturally come into your mind would be: "what
did the man do or say that was different from what others had done or
said?" It must be remembered that I had read a great deal and talked to
everyone who knew, or thought they knew anything about the subject of
alcoholism. But this was a man who had experienced many years of
frightful drinking, who had had most all the drunkard's experiences
known to man, but who had been cured by the very means I had been trying
to employ, that is to say, the spiritual approach. He gave me
information about the subject of alcoholism which was undoubtedly
helpful. Of far more importance was the fact that he was the first
living human with whom I bad ever talked, who knew what he was talking
about in regard to alcoholism from actual experience. In other words, be
talked my language. He knew all the answers, and certainly not because
he had picked them up in his reading.

It is a most wonderful blessing to be relieved of the terrible curse
with which I was afflicted. My health is good and I have regained my
self-respect and the respect of my colleagues. My home life is ideal and
my business is as good as can be expected in these uncertain times.

I spend a great deal of time passing on what I learned to others who
want and need it badly. I do it for four reasons:

1\. Sense of duty. 2. It is a pleasure.

3\. Because in so doing I am paying my debt to the man who took time to
pass it on to me.

4\. Because every time I do it I take out a little more insurance for
myself against a possible slip.

Unlike most of our crowd, I did not get over my craving for liquor much
during the first two and one-half years of abstinence. It was almost
always with me. But at no time have I been anywhere near yielding. I
used to get terribly upset when I saw my friends drink and knew I could
not, but I schooled myself to believe that though I once had the same
privilege, I had abused it so frightfully that it was withdrawn. So it
doesn't behoove me to squawk about it, for after all, nobody ever used
to throw me down and pour any liquor down my throat.

If you think you are an atheist, an agnostic, a skeptic, or have any
other form of intellectual pride which keeps you from accepting what is
in this book, I feel sorry for you. If you still think you are strong
enough to beat the game alone, that is your affair. But if you really
and truly want to quit drinking liquor for good and all, and sincerely
feel that you must have some help, we know that we have an answer for
you. It never fails if you go about it with one half the zeal you have
been in the habit of showing when getting another drink.

Your Heavenly Father will never let you down!

## Three

Pioneer member of Akron's Group No. 1, the first A.A. group in the
world. He kept the faith; therefore, he and countless others found a new
life.

ONE OF FIVE children, I was born on a Kentucky farm in Carlyle County.
My parents were well-to-do people and there marriage was a happy one. My
wife, a Kentucky girl, came with me to Akron where I completed my course
in law at the Akron Law School.

My case is rather unusual in one respect. There were no childhood
episodes of unhappiness to account for my alcoholism. I had, seemingly,
just a natural affinity for grog. My marriage was happy and, as I have
said, I never had any of the reasons, conscious or unconscious, which
are often given for drinking. Yet, as my record shows, I did become an
extremely serious case.

Before my drinking had cut me down completely, I achieved a considerable
measure of success, having been a City Councilman for five years and a
financial director of Kenmore, a suburb later taken into the city
itself. But, of course, this all went up the spout with my increased
drinking. So, at the time Dr. Bob and Bill came along I had about run
out my strength.

The first time I became intoxicated I was eight years old. This was no
fault of my father or my mother,

as they were both very much opposed to drinking. A couple of hired hands
were cleaning out the barn on the farm and I would ride to and fro on
the sled, and while they were loading I would drink hard cider out of a
barrel in the barn. On the return trip, after two or three loads, I
passed out and had to be carried to the house. I remember that my father
kept whiskey around the house for medical purposes and entertainment,
and I would drink from this when no one was about and then water it to
keep my parents from knowing I was drinking.

This continued until I enrolled in our state university and, at the end
of the four years, I realized that I was a drunk. Morning after morning
I would awake sick and with terrible jitters, but there was always a
flask of liquor sitting on the table beside my bed. I would reach over
and get this and take a shot and in a few moments get up and take
another, shave and eat my breakfast, slip a half pint of liquor in my
hip pocket, and go on to school. Between classes I would run down to the
wash room, take enough to steady ny nerves and then go on to the next
class. This was in 1917.

I left the university in the latter part of my senior year and enlisted
in the army. At the time, I called it patriotism. Later, I realized that
I was running from alcohol. It did help to a certain extent, since I got
in places where I could not obtain anything to drink, and so broke the
habitual drinking.

Then Prohibition came into effect, and the facts that the stuff
obtainable was so horrible and sometimes deadly, and that I had married
and had a job which I had to look after, helped me for a period of some
three

or four years, although I would get drunk every time I could get hold of
enough to drink to get started. My wife and I belonged to some bridge
clubs and they began to make wine and serve it. However, after two or
three trials, I found this was not satisfactory because they did not
serve enough to satisfy me. So I would refuse to drink. This problem was
soon solved, however, as I began to take my bottle along with me and
hide it in the bathroom or in the shrubbery outside.

As time went on my drinking became progressively worse. Away from my
office two or three weeks at a time; horrible days and nights when I
would lie on the floor of my home, lying awake and reaching over to get
the bottle, taking a drink and going back into oblivion.

During the first six months of 1935, I was hospitalized eight times for
intoxication and shackled to the bed two or three days before I even
knew where I was.

On June 26, 1935, I came to in the hospital and to say I was discouraged
is to put it mildly. Each of the seven times that I had left this
hospital in the last six months, I had come out fully determined in my
own mind that I would not get drunk again---for at least six or eight
months. It hadn't worked out that way and I didn't know what the matter
was and did not know what to do.

I was moved into another room that morning and there was my wife. I
thought to myself, "Well, she is going to tell me this is the end," and
I certainly couldn't blame her and did not intend to try to justify
myself. She told me that she had been talking to a couple of fellows
about drinking. I resented this very

much, until she informed me that they were a couple of drunks just as I
was. That wasn't so bad, to tell it to another drunk.

She said "You are going to quit." That was worth a lot even though I did
not believe it. Then she told me that these two drunks she had been
talking to had a plan whereby they thought they could quit drinking, and
part of that plan was that they tell it to another drunk. This was going
to help them stay sober. All the other people that had talked to me
wanted to help me, and my pride prevented me from listening to them, and
caused only resentment on my part, but I felt as if I would be a real
stinker if I did not listen to a couple of fellows for a short time, if
that would cure them. She also told me that I could not pay them even if
I wanted to and had the money, which I did not.

They came in and began to give me instruction in the program which later
became known as Alcoholics Anonymous. There was not much of it at the
time.

I looked up and there were two great big fellows over six foot tall,
very likable looking. (I knew afterwards that the two who came in were
Bill W. and Doctor Bob.) Before very long we began to relate some
incidents of our drinking, and, naturally, pretty soon, I realized both
of them knew what they were talking about because you can see things and
smell things when you're drunk, that you can't other times, and, if I
had thought they didn't know what they were talking about, I wouldn't
have been willing to talk to them at all.

After a while, Bill said, "Well, now, you've been talking a good long
time, let me talk a minute or two." So, after hearing some more of my
story, he turned

around and said to Doc---I don't think he knew I heard him, but I
did---he said, "Well, I believe he's worth saving and working on." They
said to me, "Do you want to quit drinking? It's none of our business
about your drinking. We're not up here trying to take any of your rights
or privileges away from you, but we have a program whereby we think we
can stay sober. Part of that program is that we take it to someone else,
that needs it and wants it. Now, if you don't want it, we'll not take up
your time, and we'll be going and looking for someone else."

The next thing they wanted to know was if I thought I could quit of my
own accord, without any help, if I could just walk out of the hospital
and never take another drink. If I could, that was wonderful, that was
just fine, and they would very much appreciate a person who had that
kind of power, but they were looking for a man that knew he had a
problem, and knew that he couldn't handle it himself and needed outside
help. The next question, they wanted to know was if I believed in a
Higher Power. I had no trouble there because I had never actually ceased
to believe in God, and had tried lots of times to get help but hadn't
succeeded. The next thing they wanted to know was would I be willing to
go to this Higher Power and ask for help, calmly and without any
reservations.

They left this with me to think over, and I lay there on that hospital
bed and went back over and reviewed my life. I thought of what liquor
had done to me, the opportunities that I had discarded, the abilities
that had been given to me and how I had wasted them, and I finally came
to the conclusion, that if I didn't want

to quit, I certainly ought to want to, and that I was willing to do
anything in the world to stop drinking.

I was willing to admit to myself that I had hit bottom, that I had
gotten hold of something that I didn't know how to handle by myself. So,
after reviewing these things and realizing what liquor had cost me, I
went to this Higher Power which, to me, was God, without any
reservation, and admitted that I was completely powerless over alcohol,
and that I was willing to do anything in the world to get rid of the
problem. In fact, I admitted that from now on I was willing to let God
take over, instead 0f me. Each day I would try to find out what His will
was, and try to follow that, rather than trying to get Him to always
agree that the things I thought of myself were the things best for me.
So, when they came back, I told them.

One of the fellows, I think it was Doc, said, "Well, you want to quit?"
I said, "Yes, Doc, I would like to quit, at least for five, six, or
eight months, until I get things straightened up, and begin to get the
respect of my wife and some other people back, and get my finances fixed
up and so on." And they both laughed very heartily, and said, "Thats
better than you've been doing, isn't it?" Which of course was true. They
said, "We've got some bad news for you. It was bad news for us, and it
will probably be bad news for you. Weather you quit six days, months, or
years, if you go out and take a drink or two you'll end up in the
hospital tied down, just like you have been in these past six months.
You are an alcoholic." As far as I know that was the first time I had
ever paid any attention to that word. I figured I was a drunk. And they
said, " No, you have a disease, and it doesn't make any

difference how long you do without it, after a drink or two you'll end
up just like you are now." That certainly was real disheartening news,
at the time.

The next question they asked was, "You can quit twenty-four hours, can't
you?" I said, "Sure, yes, anybody can do that, for twenty-four hours."
They said, "That's what we're talking about. Just twenty-four hours at a
time." That sure did take a load off of my mind. Every time I'd start
thinking about drinking, I would think of the long, dry years ahead
without having a drink; but this idea of twenty-four hours, that it was
up to me from then on, was a lot of help.

(At this point, the Editors intrude just long enough to supplement Bill
D.'s account, that of the man on the bed, with that of Bill W., the man
who sat by the side of the bed.) Says Bill W.: Nineteen years ago last
summer, Dr. Bob and I saw him (Bill D.) for the first time. Bill lay on
his hospital bed and looked at us in wonder.

Two days before this, Dr. Bob had said to me, "If you and I are going to
stay sober, we had better get busy." Straightway, Bob called Akron's
City Hospital and asked for the nurse on the receiving ward. He
explained that he and a man from New York had a cure for alcoholism. did
she have an alcoholic customer on whom it could be tried? Knowing Bob of
old, she jokingly replied, "Well, Doctor, I suppose you've already tried
it yourself?"

Yes, she did have a customer---a dandy. He just arrived in D.T.'s. Had
blacked the eyes of two nurses, and now they had him strapped down
tight. Would this one do? After prescribing medicines, Dr. Bob ordered,
"Put him in a private room. We'll be down as soon as he clears up."

Bill didn't seem too impressed. Looking sadder than ever, he wearily
ventured, "Well, this is wonderful for you fellows, but it can't be for
me. My case is so terrible that I'm scared to go out of this hospital at
all. You don't have

to sell me religion, either. I was at one time a deacon in the church
and I still believe in God. But I guess He doesn't believe much in me."
Then Dr. Bob said, "Well, Bill, maybe you'll feel better tomarrow.
Wouldn't you like to see us again?"

"Sure I would," replied Bill, "Maybe it won't do any good, but I'd like
to see you both, anyhow. You certainly know what you are talking about."

Looking in later we found Bill with his wife, Henrietta. Eagerly he
pointed to us saying, "These are the fellows I told you about; they are
the ones who understands."

Bill then related how he had lain awake nearly all night. Down in the
pit of his depression, new hope had somehow been born. The thought
flashed through his mind, "If they can do it, I can do it!" Over and
over he said this to himself. Finally, out of his hope, there burst
conviction. Now he was sure. Then came a great joy. At length peace
stole over him and he slept.

Before our visit was over, Bill suddenly turned to his wife and said,
"Go fetch my clothes, dear. We're going to get up and get out of here."
Bill D. walked out of that hospital a free man never to drink again.

A.A.'s Number One Group dates from that very day.

(Bill D. now continues his story.)

It was in the next two or three days after I had first met Doc and Bill,
That I finally came to a decision to turn my will over to God and to go
along with this program the best that I could. Their talk and action had
instilled me with a certain amount of confidence, although I was not too
absolutely certain. I wasn't afraid that the program wouldn't work, but
I still was doubtful whether I would be able to hang on to the program,
but I did come to the conclusion that I was willing to put everything I
had into it, with God's power, and that I wanted to do just that. As
soon as I had done that I did feel a great release. I knew that I had a
helper that I could rely upon, who wouldn't fail me. If I could stick to
Him and listen, I would make it. Then I remember when the boys came
back, that I told them, "I have gone to this Higher Power and I have
told Him that I am willing to put His world first, above everything. I
have already done it, and I am willing to do it again here in the
presence of you or I am willing to say it any place, anywhere in the
world from now on and not be ashamed of it." And this, as I said,
certainly gave me a lot of confidence, seemed to take a lot of the
burden off me.

I remember telling them too that it was going to be awfully tough,
because I did some other things, smoked cigarettes and played penny ante
poker, sometimes bet on the horse races and they said, "Don't you think
you're having more trouble with this drinking than with anything else at
the present time? Don't you believe you are going to have all you can do
to get rid of that?" I said, "Yes," reluctantly, "I probably will." They
said, "Let's forget about those other things, that is, trying to
eliminate them all at once, and concentrate on the drink." Of course, we
had talked over quite a number of failings that I had and made a sort of
an inventory, which wasn't to difficult, because I had an awful lot of
things wrong that were very apparent to me, because I knew all about
them. Then they said, "There is one more thing. You should go out and
take this program to somebody else that needs it and wants it."

Of course, by this time, my business was practically non-existent. I
didn't have any. Naturally, for quite a time, I wasn't too well
physically, either. It took me a year, or a year and a half to get to
feeling physically

well, and it was rather tough, but I soon found folks whose friendship I
had once had, and I found, after I had been sober for quite some little
time, that these people began to act like they had in previous years,
before I had gotten so bad, so that I didn't pay too awful much
attention to financial gains. I spent most of my time trying to get back
these friendships, and to make some recompense towards my wife, whom I
had hurt a lot.

It would be hard to estimate how much A.A. has done for me. I really
wanted the program and I wanted to go along with it. I noticed that the
others seemed to have such a release, a happiness, a something that I
thought a person ought to have. I was trying to find the answer. I knew
there was even more, something that I hadn't got, and I remember one
day, a week or two after I had come out of the hospital, Bill was over
to my house talking to my wife and me. We were eating lunch, and I was
listening and trying to find out why they had this release that they
seemed to have. Bill looked across at my wife, and said to her,
"Henrietta, the Lord has been so wonderful to me, curing me of this
terrible disease, that I just want to keep talking about it and telling
people."

I thought, "I think I have the answer." Bill was very, very grateful
that he had been released from this terrible thing and he had given God
the credit for having done it, and he's so grateful about it he wants to
tell other people about it. That sentence, "The Lord has been so
wonderful to me, curing me of this terrible disease, that I just want to
keep telling people about it," has been a sort of a golden text for the
A.A. program and for me.

Of course, as time went on, and I began to get my health back and began
to be so I didn't have to hide from people all the time, it's just been
wonderful. I still go to meetings, because I like to go. I meet the
people that I like to talk to. Another reason that I go is that I'm
still grateful for the good years that I've had. I'm so grateful for
both the program and the people in it that I still want to go, and then
probably the most wonderful thing that I learned from the program---I've
seen this in the 'A.A. Grapevine' a lot of times, and I've had people
say it to me personally, and I've heard people get up in meetings and
make the same statement: The statement is, "I came into A.A. solely for
the purpose of sobriety, but it has been through A.A. that I have found
God."

I feel that is about the most wonderful thing that a person can do.

## Women

Despite great opportunities, alcohol nearly ended her life. Early
member, she spread the word among women in our pioneering period.

WHAT WAS I saying . . . From far away, as if in a delirium, I had heard
my own voice---calling someone "Dorothy," talking of shops, of jobs . .
. the words came clearer . . . this sound of my own voice frightened me
as it got closer . . . and suddenly, there I was, talking of I knew not
what, to someone I'd never seen before this very moment. Abruptly I
stopped speaking. Where was I?

I'd waked up in strange rooms before, fully dressed on a bed or a couch;
I'd waked up in my own room, in or on my own bed, not knowing what hour
or day it was, afraid to ask . . . but this was different. This time I
seemed to be already awake, sitting upright in a big easy chair, in the
middle of an animated conversation with a perfectly strange young woman,
who didn't appear to think it strange. She was chatting on, pleasantly
and comfortably.

Terrified, I looked around. I was in a large, dark, rather poorly
furnished room---the living room of a basement flat. Cold chills started
chasing up and down my spine; my teeth were chattering; my hands were
shaking so I tucked them under to keep them from flying away. My fright
was real enough, but it

didn't account for these violent reactions. I knew what they were, all
right---a drink would fix them. It must have been a long time since I
had my last drink---but I didn't dare ask this stranger for one. I must
get out of here. In any case I must get out of here before I let slip my
abysmal ignorance of how I came to be here, and she realized that I was
stark, staring mad. I was mad---I must be.

The shakes grew worse and I looked at my watch---six o'clock. It had
been one o'clock when I last remembered looking. I'd been sitting
comfortably in a restaurant with Rita, drinking my sixth martini and
hoping the waiter would forget about the lunch order---at least long
enough for me to have a couple more. I'd only had two with her, but I'd
managed four in the fifteen minutes I'd waited for her, and of course
I'd had the usual uncounted swigs from the bottle as I painfully got up
and did my slow spasmodic dressing. In fact I had been in very good
shape at one o'clock---feeling no pain. What could have happened? That
had been in the center of New York, on noisy 42nd Street . . . this was
obviously a quiet residential section. Why had "Dorothy" brought me
here? Who was she? How had I met her? I had no answers, and I dared not
ask. She gave no sign of recognizing anything wrong, but what had I been
doing for those lost five hours? My brained whirled. I might have done
terrible things, and I wouldn't even know it!

Somehow I got out of there and walked five blocks past brownstone
houses. There wasn't a bar in sight, but I found the subway station. The
name on it was unfamiliar and I had to ask the way to Grand Central. It
took three-quarters of an hour and two changes to

get there---back to my starting point. I had been in the remote reaches
of Brooklyn.

That night I got very drunk, which was usual, but I remembered
everything, which was very unusual. I remembered going through what my
sister assured me was my nightly procedure of trying to find Willie
Seabrook's name in the telephone book. I remembered my loud resolution
to find him and ask him to help me get into that "Asylum" he had written
about. I remembered asserting that I was going to do something about
this, that I couldn't go on . . . I remembered looking longingly at the
window as an easier solution, and shuddering at the memory of that other
window, three years before, and the six agonizing months in a London
hospital ward. I remembered filling the Peroxide bottle in my medicine
chest with gin, in case my sister found the bottle I hid under the
mattress. And I remembered the creeping horror of the interminable
night, in which I slept for short spells and woke dripping with cold
sweat and shaken with utter despair, to drink hastily from my bottle and
mercifully pass out again, "You're mad, you're mad, you're mad!" pounded
through my brain with each returning ray of consciousness, and I drowned
the refrain with drink.

That went on for two more months before I landed in a hospital and
started my slow fight back to normalcy. It had been going on like that
for over a year. I was thirty-two years old.

When I look back on that last horrible year of constant drinking I
wonder how I survived it either physically or mentally. For there were
of course periods of clear realization of what I had become,

attended by memories of what I had been, what I had expected to be. And
the contrast was pretty shattering. Sitting in a Second Avenue bar,
accepting drinks from anyone who offered, after my small stake was gone;
or sitting at home alone, with the inevitable glass in my hand, I would
remember, and remembering, I would drink faster, seeking speedy
oblivion. It was hard to reconcile this ghastly present with the simple
facts of the past.

My family had money---I had never known denial of any material desire.
The best boarding schools and a finishing school in Europe had fitted me
for the conventional role of debutante and young matron. The times in
which I grew up (the Prohibition era immortalized by Scott Fitzgerald
and John Held Jr.) had taught me to be gay with the gayest; my own inner
urges led me to outdo them all. The year after coming out, I married. So
far, so good---all according to plan, like thousands of others. But then
the story became my own. My husband was an alcoholic---I had only
contempt for those without my own amazing capacity---the outcome was
inevitable. My divorce coincided with my father's bankruptcy, and I went
to work, casting off all allegiances and responsibilites to any other
than myself. For me, work was only a different means to the same end, to
be able to do exactly what I wanted to do.

For the next ten years I did just that. For greater freedom and
excitement I went abroad to live. I had my own business, successful
enough for me to indulge most of my desires. I met all the peple I
wanted to meet; I saw all the places I wanted to see; I did all the
things I wanted to do---and I was increasingly miser-

able. Headstrong and willful, I rushed from pleasure to pleasure, and
found the returns diminishing to the vanishing point. Hangovers began to
assume monstrous proportions and the morning drink became an urgent
necessity. "Blanks" were more frequent, and I seldom knew how I'd got
home. When my friends suggested that I was drinking too much---they were
no longer my friends. I moved from group to group---then from place to
place---and went on drinking. With a creeping insidiousness, drink had
become more important than anything else. It no longer gave me
pleasure---it merely dulled the pain---but I had to have it. I was
bitterly unhappy. No doubt I had been an exile too long---I should go
home to America. I did. And to my surprise, my drinking grew worse.

When I entered a sanitarium for prolonged and intensive psychiatric
treatment, I was convinced that I was having a serious mental breakdown.
I wanted help, and I tried to cooperate. As the treatment progressed I
began to get a picture of myself, of the temperament that had caused me
so much trouble. I had been hypersensitive, shy, idealistic. My
inability to accept the harsh realities of life had resulted in a
disillusioned cynic, clothed in a protective armor against the world's
misunderstanding. That armor had turned into prison walls, locking me in
loneliness---and fear. All I had left was an iron determination to live
my own life in spite of the alien world---and here I was, an inwardly
frightened, outwardly defiant woman, who desperately needed a prop to
keep going.

Alcohol was that prop, and I didn't see how I could live without it.
When My doctor told me I should never touch a drink again, I couldn't
afford to believe

him. I had to persist in my attempts to get straightened out enough to
be able to use the drinks I needed, without their turning on me.
Besides, how could he understand? He wasn't a drinking man, he didn't
know what it was to need a drink, nor what a drink could do for one in a
pinch. I wanted to live, not in a desert, but in a normal world; and my
idea of a normal world was among people who drank---teetotallers were
not included. And I was sure that I couldn't be with people who drank,
without drinking. In that I was correct: I couldn't be comfortable with
any kind of people without drinking. I never had been.

Naturally, inspite of my good intentions, in spite of my protected life
behind sanitarium walls, I several times got drunk, and was astounded .
. . and badly shaken.

That was the point at which my doctor gave me the book "Alcoholics
Anonymous" to read. The first chapters were a revelation to me. I wasn't
the only person in the world who felt and behaved like this! I wasn't
mad or vicious---I was a sick person. I was suffering from an actual
disease that had a name and symptoms like diabetes or cancer or TB---and
a disease was respectable, not a moral stigma! But then I hit a snag. I
couldn't stomach religion, and I didn't like the mention of God or any
of the other capital letters. If that was the way out, it wasn't for me.
I was an intellectual and I needed an intellectual answer, not an
emotional one. I told my doctor so in no uncertain terms. I wanted to
learn to stand on my own two feet, not to change one prop for another,
and an intangible and dubious one at that. And so on and on, for several
weeks, while I grudgingly plowed through some more

of the offending book, and felt more and more hopeless about myself.

Then the miracle happened---to me! It isn't always so sudden with
everyone, but I ran into a personal crisis which filled me with a raging
and righteous anger. And as I fumed helplessly and planned to get good
and drunk and show them, my eye caught a sentence in the book lying open
on my bed: "We cannot live with anger." The walls crumpled---and the
light streamed in. I wasn't trapped. I wasn't helpless. I was free, and
I didn't have to drink to "show them." This wasn't "religion"---this was
freedom! Freedom from anger and fear, freedom to know happiness and
love.

I went to a meeting to see for myself this group of freaks or bums who
had done this thing. To go into a gathering of people was the sort of
thing that all my life, from the time I left my private world of books
and dreams to meet the real world of people and parties and jobs, had
left me feeling an uncomfortable outsider, needing the warming stimulus
of drinks to join in. I went trembling into a house in Brooklyn filled
with strangers . . . and I found I had come home at last, to my own
kind. There is another meaning for the Hebrew word that in the King
James version of the Bible is translated "salvation." It is: "to come
home." I had found my salvation. I wasn't alone any more.

That was the beginning of a new life, a fuller life, a happier life than
I had ever known or believed possible. I had found friends,
understanding friends who often knew what I was thinking and feeling
better than I knew myself, and didn't allow me to retreat into

my prison of loneliness and fear over a fancied slight or hurt. Talking
things over with them, great floods of enlightenment showed me myself as
I really was and I was like them. We all had hundreds of character
traits, of fears and phobias, likes and dislikes, in common. Suddenly I
could accept myself, faults and all, as I was---for weren't we all like
that? And, accepting, I felt a new inner comfort, and the willingness
and strength to do something about the traits I couldn't live with.

It didn't stop there. They knew what to do about those black abysses
that yawned ready to swallow me when I felt depressed, or nervous. There
was a concrete program, designed to secure the greatest possible inner
security for us long-time escapists. The feeling of impending disaster
that had haunted me for years began to dissolve as I put into practice
more and more of the Twelve Steps. It worked!

An active member of A.A. since 1939, I feel myself a useful member of
the human race at last. I have something to contribute to humanity,
since I am peculiarly qualified, as a fellow-sufferer, to give aid and
comfort to those who have stumbled and fallen over this business of
meeting life. I get my greatest thrill of accomplishment from the
knowledge that I have played a part in the new happiness achieved by
countless others like myself. The fact that I can work again and earn my
living, is important, but secondary. I believe that my once over-weening
self-will has finally found its proper place, for I can say many times
daily, "Thy will be done, not mine" . . . and mean it.

## Southern

Pioneer A.A., minister's son, and southern farmer, "Who am I," said he,
"to say there is no God?"

FATHER IS AN Episcopal minister and his work takes him over long drives
on bad roads. His parishioners are limited in number, but his friends
are many, for to him race, creed, or social position make no difference.
It is not long before he drives up in the buggy. Both he and old Maud
are glad to get home. The drive was long and cold but he was thankful
for the hot bricks which some thoughtful person had given him for his
feet. Soon supper is on the table. Father says grace, which delays my
attack on the buckwheat cakes and sausage.

Bed-time comes. I climb to my room in the attic. It is cold so there is
no delay. I craw under a pile of blankets and blow out the candle. The
wind is rising and howls around the house. But I am safe and warm. I
fall into a dreamless sleep.

I am in church. Father is delivering his sermon. A wasp is crawling up
the back of the lady in front of me. I wonder if it will reach her neck.
Shucks! It has flown away. At last! The message has been delivered.

"Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works-."
I hunt for my nickel to drop in the plate so that mine will be seen.

I am in another fellow's room at colledge. "Fresh-

man," said he to me, "do you ever take a drink?" I hesitated. Father had
never directly spoken to me about drinking but he never drank any, so
far as I knew. Mother hated liquor and feared a drunken man. Her brother
had been a drinker and had died in a state hospital for the insane. But
his life was unmentioned, so far as I was concerned. I had never had a
drink, but I had seen enough merriment in the boys who were drinking to
be interested. I would never be like the village drunkard at home.

"Well," said the older boy, "Do you?"

"Once in a while," I lied. I could not let him think I was a sissy.

He poured out two drinks. "Here's looking at you," said he. I gulped it
down and choked. I didn't like it, but I would not say so. A mellow glow
stole over me. This wasn't so bad after all. Sure I'd have another. The
glow increased. Other boys came in. My tongue loosened. Everyone laughed
loudly. I was witty. I had no inferiorities. Why, I wasn't even ashamed
of my skinny legs! This was the real thing!

A haze filled the room. The electric light began to move. Then two bulbs
appeared. The faces of the other boys grew dim. How sick I felt. I
staggered to the bathroom. Shouldn't have drunk so much or so fast. But
I knew how to handle it now. I'd drink like a gentleman after this.

And so I met John Barleycorn. The grand fellow who at my call made me "a
hale fellow, well met," who gave me such a fine voice, as we sang,
"Hail, hail, the gang's all here," and "Sweet Adeline," who gave me
freedom from fear and feelings of inferiority. Good old John! He was my
pal, all right.

Final exams of my Senior year and I may somehow graduate. I would never
have tried, but mother counts on it so. A case of measles saved me from
being kicked out during my Sophomore year.

But the end is in sight. My last exam and an easy one. I gaze at the
board with its questions. Can't remember the answer to the first. I'll
try the second. No soap there. I don't seem to remember anything. I
concentrate on one of the questions. I don't seem to be able to keep my
mind on what I am doing. I get uneasy. If I don't get started soon, I
won't have time to finish. No use. I can't think.

I leave the room, which the honor system allows. I go to my room. I pour
out half a tumbler of grain alcohol and fill it with ginger ale. Now
back to the exam. My pen moves rapidly. I know enough of the answers to
get by. Good old John Barleycorn! He can certainly be depended on. What
a wonderful power he has over the mind! He has given me my diploma!

Underweight! How I hate that word. Three attempts to enlist in the
service, and three failures because of being skinny. True, I have
recently recovered from pneumonia and have an alibi, but my friends are
in the war or going, and I am not. I visit a friend who is awaiting
orders. The atmosphere of "eat, drink, and be merry" prevails and I
absorb it. I drink a lot every night. I can hold a lot now, more than
the others.

I am examined for the draft and pass the physical test. I am to go to
camp on November 13th. The Armistice is signed on the 11th and the draft
is called off. Never in the service! The war leaves me with a pair of
blankets, a toilet kit, a sweater knit by my sister, and a still greater
inferiority.

It is ten o'clock of a Saturday night. I am working hard on the books of
a subsidiary company of a large corporation. I have had experience in
selling, collecting, and accounting, and am on my way up the ladder.

Then the crack-up. Cotton struck the skids and collections went cold. A
twenty three million dollar surplus wiped out. Offices closed up and
workers discharged. I, and the books of my division, have been
transferred to the head office. I have no assistance and am working
nights, Saturdays and Sundays. My salary has been cut. My wife and new
baby are fortunately staying with relatives. I feel exhausted. The
doctor has told me that if I don't give up inside work, I'll have
tuberculosis. But what am I to do? I have a family to support and have
no time to be looking for another job.

I reach for the bottle which I just got from George, the elevator boy.

I am a traveling salesman. The day is over and business has been not so
good. I'll go to bed. I wish I were home with the family and not in this
dingy hotel.

Well-well-look who's here! Good old Charlie! It's great to see him.
How's the boy? A drink? You bet your life! We buy a gallon of "corn"
because it is so cheap. Yet I am fairly steady when I go to bed.

Morning comes. I feel horribly. A little drink will put me on my feet.
But it takes others to keep me there.

I become a teacher in a boy's school. I am happy in my work. I like the
boys and we have lots of fun, in class and out.

The doctors bills are heavy and the bank account is low. My wife's
parents come to our assistance. I am filled with hurt pride and
self-pity. I seem to get no sympathy for my illness and have no
appreciation of the love behind the gift.

I call the bootlegger and fill up my charred keg. But I do not wait for
the charred keg to work. I get drunk. My wife is extremely unhappy. Her
father comes to sit with me. He never says an unkind word. He is a real
friend but I do not appreciate him.

We are staying with my wife's father. Her mother is in critical
condition at a hospital. I cannot sleep. I must get myself together. I
sneak down stairs and get a bottle of whiskey from the cellaret. I pour
drinks down my throat. My father-in-law appears. "Have a drink?" I ask.
He makes no reply, and hardly seems to see me. His wife dies that night.

Mother has been dying of cancer for a long time. She is near the end now
and is in a hospital. I have been drinking a lot, but never get drunk.
Mother must never know. I see her about to go.

I return to the hotel where I am staying and get gin from the bellboy. I
drink and go to bed; I take a few the next morning and go see my mother
once more. I cannot stand it. I go back to the hotel and get more gin. I
drink steadily. I come to at three in the morning. The indescribable
torture has me again. I turn on the light. I must get out of the room or
I shall jump out of the window. I walk miles. No use. I go to the
hospital, where I have made friends with the night superintendent. She
puts me to bed and gives me a hypodermic.

I am at the hospital to see my wife. We have an-

other child. But she is not glad to see me. I have been drinking while
the baby was arriving. Her father stays with her.

It is a cold, bleak day in November. I have fought hard to stop
drinking. Each battle has ended in defeat. I tell my wife I cannot stop
drinking. She begs me to go to a hospital for alcoholics which has been
recommended. I say I will go. She makes the arrangements, but I will not
go. I'll do it all myself. This time I'm off of it for good. I'll just
take a few beers now and then.

It is the last day of the following October, a dark, rainy morning. I
come to in a pile of hay in a barn. I look for liquor and can't find
any. I wander to a stable and drink five bottles of beer. I must get
some liquor. Suddenly I feel hopeless, unable to go on. I go home. My
wife is in the living room. She had looked for me last evening after I
left the car and wandered off into the night. She had looked for me this
morning. She has reached the end of her rope. There is no use trying any
more, for there is nothing to try. "Don't say anything," I say to her.
"I am going to do something."

I am in the hospital for alcoholics. I am an alcoholic. The insane
asylum lies ahead. Could I have myself locked up at home? One more
foolish idea. I might go out West on a ranch where I couldn't get
anything to drink. I might do that. Another foolish idea. I wish I were
dead, as I have often wished before. I am too yellow to kill myself.

Four alcoholics play bridge in a smoke-filled room. Anything to get my
mind from myself. The game is over and the other three leave. I start to
clean up the

debris. One man comes back, closing the door behind him.

He looks at me. "You think you are hopeless, don't you?" he asks.

"I know it," I reply.

"Well, you're not," says the man. "There are men on the streets of New
York today who were worse than you, and they don't drink anymore."

"What are you doing here then?" I ask.

"I went out of here nine days ago saying that I was going to be honest,
and I wasn't," he answers.

A fanatic, I thought to myself, but I was polite. "What is it?" I
enquire.

Then he asks me if I believe in a power greater than myself, whether I
call that power God, Allah, Confucius, Prime Cause, Divine Mind, or any
other name. I told him that I believe in electricity and other forces of
nature, but as for a God, if there is one, He has never done anything
for me. Then he asks me if I am willing to right all the wrongs I have
ever done to anyone, no matter how wrong I thought the others were. Am I
willing to be honest with myself about myself and tell someone about
myself, and am I willing to think of other people, of their needs
instead of myself, in order to get rid of the drink problem?

"I'll do anything," I reply.

"Then all of your troubles are over," says the man and leaves the room.
The man is in bad mental shape certainly. I pick up a book and try to
read, but cannot concentrate. I get in bed and turn out the light. But I
cannot sleep. Suddenly a thought comes. Can all the worthwhile people I
have known be wrong about God? Then I find myself thinking about myself,

and a few things that I had wanted to forget. I begin to see I am not
the person I had thought myself, that I had judged myself by comparing
myself to others, and always to my own advantage. It is a shock.

Then comes a thought that is like A Voice. "Who are you to say there is
no God?" It rings in my head; I can't get rid of it.

I get out of bed and go to the man's room. He is reading. "I must ask
you a question," I say to the man. "How does prayer fit into this
thing?"

"Well," he answers, "you've probably tried praying like I have. When
you've been in a jam you've said, 'God, please do this or that,' and if
it turned out your way that was the last of it, and if it didn't you've
said 'There isn't any God' or 'He doesn't do anything for me'. Is that
right?"

"Yes" I reply.

"That isn't the way" he continued. "The thing I do is to say 'God here I
am and here are all my troubles. I've made a mess of things and can't do
anything about it. You take me, and all my troubles, and do anything you
want with me.' Does that answer your question?"

"Yes, it does" I answer. I return to bed. It doesn't make sense.
Suddenly I feel a wave of utter hopelessness sweep over me. I am in the
bottom of hell. And there a tremendous hope is born. It might be true.

I tumble out of bed onto my knees. I know not what I say. But slowly a
great peace comes to me. I believe in God. I crawl back into bed and
sleep like a child.

Some men and women come to visit my friend of the night before. He
invites me to meet them. They are a joyous crowd. I have never seen
people that joyous

before. We talk. I tell them of the peace, and that I believe in God. I
think of my wife. I must write her. One girl suggests that I phone her.
What a wonderful idea!

My wife hears my voice and knows I have found the answer to life. She
comes to New York. I get out of the hospital and we visit some of these
new-found friends.

I am home again. I have lost the fellowship. Those that understand me
are far away. The same old problems and worries surround me. Members of
my family annoy me. Nothing seems to be working out right. I am blue and
unhappy. Maybe a drink---I put on my hat and dash off in the car.

Get into the lives of other people, is one thing the fellows in New York
had said. I go to see a man I had been asked to visit and tell him my
story. I feel much better! I have forgotten about a drink.

I am on a train, headed for a city. I have left my wife at home, sick,
and I have been unkind to her in leaving. I am very unhappy. Maybe a few
drinks when I get to the city will help. A great fear seizes me. I talk
to the stranger in the seat beside me. The fear and the insane idea is
taken away.

Things are not going so well at home. I am learning that I cannot have
my own way as I used to. I blame my wife and children. Anger possesses
me, anger such as I have never felt before. I will not stand for it. I
pack my bag and leave. I stay with understanding friends.

I see where I have been wrong in some respects. I do not feel angry any
more. I return home and say I am sorry for my wrong. I am quiet again.
But I have

not seen yet that I should do some constructive acts of love without
expecting any return. I shall learn this after some more explosions.

I am blue again. I want to sell the place and move away. I want to get
where I can find some alcoholics to help, and where I can have some
fellowship. A man calls me on the phone. Will I take a young fellow who
has been drinking for two weeks to live with me? Soon I have others who
are alcoholics and some who have other problems.

I begin to play God. I feel that I can fix them all. I do not fix
anyone, but I am getting part of a tremendous education and I have made
some new friends.

Nothing is right. Finances are in bad shape. I must find a way to make
some money. The family seems to think of nothing but spending. People
annoy me. I try to read. I try to pray. Gloom surrounds me. Why has God
left me? I mope around the house. I will not go out and I will not enter
into anything. What is the matter? I cannot understand. I will not be
that way.

I'll get drunk! It is a cold-blooded idea. It is premeditated. I fix up
a little apartment over the garage with books and drinking water. I am
going to town to get some liquor and food. I shall not drink until I get
back to the apartment. Then I shall lock myself in and read. And as I
read, I shall take little drinks at long intervals. I shall get myself
"mellow" and stay that way.

I get in the car and drive off. Halfway down the driveway a thought
strikes me. I'll be honest anyway. I'll tell my wife what I am going to
do. I back up to the door and go into the house. I call my wife into a

room where we can talk privately. I tell her quietly what I intend to
do. She says nothing. She does not get excited. She maintains a perfect
calm.

When I am through speaking, the whole idea has become absurd. Not a
trace of fear is in me. I laugh at the insanity of it. We talk of other
things. Strength has come from weakness.

I cannot see the cause of this temptation now. But I am to learn later
that it began with my desire for material success becoming greater than
my interest in the welfare of my fellow man. I learn more of that
foundation stone of character, which is honesty. I learn that when we
act upon the highest conception of honesty which is given us, our sense
of honesty becomes more acute.

I learn that honesty is truth, and the truth shall make us free!

## Vicious

How it finally broke a Southerner's obstinacy and destined this salesman
to start A.A. at Philadelphia.

JANUARY 8, 1938---that was my D-Day; the place, Washington, D.C. This
last real merry-go-round had started the day before Christmas and I had
really accomplished a lot in those fourteen days. First, my new wife had
walked out, bag, baggage and furniture; then the apartment landlord had
thrown me out of the empty apartment and the finish was the loss of
another job. After a couple of days in dollar hotels and one night in
the pokey, I finally landed on my mother's doorstep---shaking apart,
with several days' beard and, of course, broke as usual. Many of these
same things had happened to me many times before, but this time they had
all descended together. For me, this was It.

Here I was, thirty-nine years old and a complete washout. Nothing had
worked. Mother would take me in only if I would stay locked in a small
storeroom and give her my clothes and shoes. We had played this game
before. That is the way Jackie found me, lying on a cot in my skivvies,
with hot and cold sweats, pounding heart and that awful itchy
scratchiness all over. Somehow I had always managed to avoid D.T.'s.

I had not asked for help and seriously doubt that I would have, but
Fitz, an old school friend of mine,

had persuaded Jackie to call on me. Had he come two or three days later
I think I would have thrown him out, but he hit when I was open for
anything.

Jackie arrived about seven in the evening and talked until three a.m. I
don't remember much of what he said, but I did realize that here was
another guy exactly like me; he had been in the same laughing academies
and the same jails, known the same loss of jobs, same frustrations, same
boredom and the same loneliness. If anything, he had known all of them
even better and more often than I. Yet he was happy, relaxed, confident
and laughing. That night for the first time in my life I really let down
my hair and admitted my general loneliness. Jackie told me about a group
of fellows in New York, of whom my old friend Fitz was one, who had the
same problem I had, and who by working together to help each other were
not now drinking and were happy like himself. He said something about
God or a Higher Power, but I brushed that off---that was for the birds,
not for me. Little more of our talk stayed in my memory, but I do know I
slept the rest of that night, while before I had never known what a real
night's sleep was.

This was my introduction to this "understanding fellowship" although it
was to be more than a year later before our Society was to bear the name
Alcoholics Anonymous. All of us in A.A. know the tremendous happiness
that is in our sobriety, but there are also tragedies. My sponsor,
Jackie, was one of these. He brought in many of our original members,
yet he himself could not make it and died of alcoholism. The lesson of
his death still remains with me, yet I often wonder what would have
happened if somebody

else had made that first call on me. So I always say that as long as I
remember January 8th that is how long I will remain sober.

The age-old question in A.A. is which came first, the neurosis or the
alcoholism. I like to think I was fairly normal before alcohol took
over. My early life was spent in Baltimore where my father was a
physician and a grain merchant. My family lived in very prosperous
circumstances, and while both my parents drank, sometimes too much,
neither was an alcoholic. Father was a very well-integrated person, and
while mother was highstrung and a bit selfish and demanding, our home
life was reasonably harmonious. There were four of us children, and
although both of my brothers later became alcoholic---one died of
alcoholism---my sister has never taken a drink in her life.

Until I was thirteen I attended public schools, with regular promotions
and average grades. I have never shown any particular talents nor have I
had any really frustrating ambitions. At thirteen I was packed off to a
very fine Protestant boarding school in Virginia, where I stayed four
years, graduating without any special achievements. In sports I made the
track and tennis teams; I got along well with the other boys and had a
fairly large circle of acquaintances but no intimate friends. I was
never homesick and was always pretty self-sufficient.

However, here I probably took my first step towards my coming alcoholism
by developing a terrific aversion to all churches and established
religions. At this school we had Bible readings before each meal, and
church services four times on Sunday, and I became so rebellious at this
that I swore I would never join or

go to any church except for weddings and funerals.

At seventeen I entered the University, really to satisfy my father who
wanted me to study medicine there as he had. That is where I had my
first drink and I still remember it, for every "first" drink afterwards
did exactly the same trick---I could feel it go right through every bit
of my body and down to my very toes. But each drink after the "first"
seemed to become less effective and after three or four they all seemed
like water. I was never a hilarious drunk; the more I drank the quieter
I got, and the drunker I got the harder I fought to stay sober. So it is
clear that I never had any fun out of drinking---I would be the
soberest-seeming one in the crowd and all of a sudden I was the
drunkest. Even that first night I blacked out, which leads me to believe
that I was an alcoholic from my very first drink. The first year in
college I just got by in my studies, and that year I majored in poker
and drinking. I refused to join any fraternity, as I wanted to be a free
lance, and that year my drinking was confined to one-night stands, once
or twice a week. The second year my drinking was more or less restricted
to weekends, but I was nearly kicked out for scholastic failure.

In the spring of 1917, in order to beat being fired from school, I
became "patriotic" and joined the Army. I am one of the lads who came
out of the service with a lower rank than when I went in. I had been to
OTC the previous summer, so I went into the Army as a sergeant, but I
came out a private, and you really have to be unusual to do that. In the
next two years I washed more pans and peeled more potatoes than any
other doughboy. In the Army, I became a periodic

alcoholic---the periods always coming whenever I could make the
opportunity. However, I did manage to keep out of the guardhouse. My
last bout in the Army lasted from November 5th to 11th, 1918. We heard
by wireless on the 5th that the Armistice would be signed the next day
(this was a premature report) so I had a couple of cognacs to celebrate;
then I hopped a truck and went AWOL. My next conscious memory was in Bar
le Duc, many miles from base. It was November 11th and bells were
ringing and whistles blowing for the real Armistice. There I was,
unshaven, clothes torn and dirty with no recollection of wandering all
over France but, of course, a hero to the local French. Back at camp,
all was forgiven because it was the End, but in the light of what I have
since learned I know I was a confirmed alcoholic at nineteen.

With the war over, and back in Baltimore with the folks, there were
several small jobs for three years and then I went to work soliciting as
one of the first ten employees of a new national finance company. What
an opportunity I shot to pieces there! This company now does a volume of
over three billion dollars annually. Three years later, at twenty-five,
I opened and operated their Philadelphia office and was earning more
than I ever have since. I was the fair-haired boy all right, but two
years later I was blacklisted as an irresponsible drunk. It doesn't take
long.

My next job was in sales promotion for an oil company in Mississippi
where I promptly became high man and got lots of pats on the back. Then
I turned two company cars over in a short time and Bingo---fired again.
Oddly enough, the big shot who

fired me from this company was one of the first men I met when I later
joined the New York A.A. Group. He had also gone all the way through the
wringer and had been dry two years when I saw him again.

After the oil job blew up, I went back to Baltimore and mother, my first
wife having said a permanent "Goodbye." Then came a sales job with a
national tire company. I re-organized their city sales policy and
eighteen months later, when I was thirty, they offered me the branch
managership. As part of this promotion, they sent me to their national
convention in Atlantic City to tell the big wheels how I'd done it. At
this time I was holding what drinking I did down to weekends, but I
hadn't had a drink at all in a month. I checked into my hotel room and
then noticed a placard tucked under the glass on the bureau stating
"There will be positively NO drinking at this convention" signed by the
president of the company. That did it! Who, me? The Big Shot? The only
salesman invited to talk at the convention? The man who was going to
take over one of the biggest branches come Monday? I'd show 'em who was
boss! No one in that company saw me again---ten days later I wired my
resignation.

As long as things were tough and the job a challenge I could always
manage to hold on pretty well, but as soon as I learned the combination,
got the puzzle under control and the boss to pat me on the back, I was
gone again. Routine jobs bored me, but I would take on the toughest one
I could find, work day and night until I had it under control; then it
would become tedious and I'd lose all interest in it. I could never be
bothered with the follow-through and would

invariably reward myself for my efforts with that "first" drink.

After the tire job came the thirties, the Depression and the down hill
road. In the eight years before A.A. found me, I had over forty
jobs---selling and traveling---one thing after another, and the same old
routine. I'd work like mad for three or four weeks without a single
drink, save my money, pay a few bills and then "reward" myself with
alcohol. Then broke again, hiding out in cheap hotels all over the
country, one night jail stands here and there, and always that horrible
feeling "What's the use---nothing is worth while." Every time I blacked
out, and that was every time I drank, there was always that gnawing
fear, "What did I do this time?" Once I found out. Many alcoholics have
learned they can bring their bottle to a cheap movie theater and drink,
sleep, wake up and drink again in the darkness. I had repaired to one of
these one morning with my jug and when I left late in the afternoon, I
picked up a newspaper on the way home. Imagine my surprise when I read
in a page one "box" that I had been taken from the theater unconscious
around noon that day, removed by ambulance to a hospital and
stomach-pumped and then released. Evidently I had gone right back to the
movie with a bottle, stayed there several hours and started home with no
recollection of what had happened.

The mental state of the sick alcoholic is beyond description. I had no
resentments against individuals---the whole world was all wrong. My
thoughts went round and round with "What's it all about anyhow? People
have wars and kill each other; they struggle and cut each other's
throats for success and what does

anyone get out of it? Haven't I been successful, haven't I accomplished
extraordinary things in business? What do I get out of it? Everything's
all wrong and the hell with it." For the last two years of my drinking I
prayed on every drink that I wouldn't wake up again. Three months before
I met Jackie I had made my second feeble try at suicide.

This was the background that made me willing to listen on January 8th.
After being dry two weeks and sticking close to Jackie, all of a sudden
I found I had become the sponsor of my sponsor, for he was suddenly
taken drunk. I was startled to learn he had only been off the booze a
month or so himself when he brought me the message! However, I made an
SOS call to the New York Group, whom I hadn't met yet, and they
suggested we both come there. This we did the next day, and what a trip!
I really had a chance to see myself from a non-drinking point of view.
We checked into the home of Hank, the man who had fired me eleven years
before in Mississippi, and there I met Bill, our founder. Bill had then
been dry three years and Hank, two. At the time, I thought them just a
swell pair of screwballs, for they were not only going to save all the
drunks in the world but also all the so-called normal people! All they
talked of that first weekend was God, and how they were going to
straighten out Jackie's and my life. In those days we really took each
other's inventories firmly and often. Despite all this, I did like these
new friends because, again, they were like me. They had also been
periodic big shots who had goofed out repeatedly at the wrong time, and
they also knew how to split one paper match into three separate matches.
(This is very use-

ful knowledge in places where matches are prohibited.) They, too, had
taken a train to one town and had wakened hundreds of miles in the
opposite direction, never knowing how they got there. The same old
routines seemed to be common to us all. During that first weekend I
decided to stay in New York and take all they gave out with, except the
"God stuff." I knew they needed to straighten out their thinking and
habits, but I was all right, I just drank too much. Just give me a good
front and a couple of bucks and I'd be right back in the big time. I'd
been dry three weeks, had the wrinkles out and had sobered up my sponsor
all by myself!

Bill and Hank had just taken over a small automobile polish company and
they offered me a job---ten dollars a week and keep at Hank's house. We
were all set to put DuPont out of business.

At that time the group in New York was composed of about twelve men who
were working on the principle of every drunk for himself; we had no real
formula and no name. We would follow one man's ideas for a while, decide
he was wrong and switch to another's method. But we were staying sober
as long as we kept and talked together. There was one meeting a week at
Bill's home in Brooklyn, and we all took turns there spouting off about
how we had changed our lives overnight, how many drunks we had saved and
straightened out, and last, but not least, how God had touched each of
us personally on the shoulder. Boy, what a circle of confused idealists!
Yet we all had one really sincere purpose in our hearts and that was not
to drink. At our weekly meeting I was a menace to serenity those first
few months, for I took

every opportunity to lambaste that "spiritual angle" as we called it, or
anything else that had any tinge of theology. Much later I discovered
the elders held many prayer meetings hoping to find a way to give me the
heave-ho, but at the same time stay tolerant and spiritual. They did not
seem to be getting an answer, for here I was staying sober and selling
lots of auto polish, on which they were making one thousand percent
profit. So I rocked along my merry independent way until June, when I
went out selling auto polish in New England. After a very good week, two
of my customers took me to lunch on Saturday. We ordered sandwiches and
one man said, "Three beers." I let mine sit. After a bit, the other man
said, "Three beers." I let that sit too. Then it was my turn---I ordered
"Three beers," but this time it was different, I had a cash investment
of thirty cents and, on a ten dollar a week salary, that's a big thing.
So I drank all three beers, one after the other, said, "I'll be seeing
you, boys," and went around the corner for a bottle. I never saw either
of them again.

I had completely forgotten the January 8th when I found the fellowship,
and I spent the next four days wandering around New England half drunk,
by which I mean I couldn't get drunk and I couldn't get sober. I tried
to contact the boys in New York, but telegrams bounced right back and
when I finally got Hank on the telephone he fired me right then. This
was when I really took my first good look at myself. My loneliness was
worse than it had ever been before, for now even my own kind had turned
against me. This time it really hurt, more than any hangover ever had.
My brilliant agnosticism vanished, and I saw for the first

time that those who really believed, or at least honestly tried to find
a Power greater than themselves, were much more composed and contented
than I had ever been, and they seemed to have a degree of happiness
which I had never known.

Peddling off my polish samples for expenses, I crawled back to New York
a few days later in a very chastened frame of mind. When the others saw
my altered attitude they took me back in, but for me they had to make it
tough; if they hadn't I don't think I ever would have stuck it out. Once
again, there was the challenge of a tough job, but this time I was
determined to follow through. For a long time the only Higher Power I
could concede was the power of the group, but this was far more than I
had ever recognized before, and it was at least a beginning. It was also
an ending, for never since June 16th, 1938, have I had to walk alone.

Around this time our big A.A. book was being written and it all became
much simpler; we had a definite formula which some sixty of us agreed
was the middle course for all alcoholics who wanted sobriety, and that
formula has not been changed one iota down through the years. I don't
think the boys were completely convinced of my personality change, for
they fought shy of including my story in the book, so my only
contribution to their literary efforts was my firm conviction, being
still a theological rebel, that the word God should be qualified with
the phrase "as we understand him"--- for that was the only way I could
accept spirituality.

After the book appeared we all became very busy in our efforts to save
all and sundry, but I was still

actually on the fringes of A.A. While I went along with all that was
done and attended the meetings, I never took an active job of leadership
until February 1940. Then I got a very good position in Philadelphia and
quickly found I would need a few fellow alcoholics around me if I was to
stay sober. Thus I found myself in the middle of a brand new group. When
I started to tell the boys how we did it in New York and all about the
spiritual part of the program, I found they would not believe me unless
I was practicing what I preached. Then I found that as I gave in to this
spiritual or personality change I was getting a little more serenity. In
telling newcomers how to change their lives and attitudes, all of a
sudden I found I was doing a little changing myself. I had been too
self-sufficient to write a moral inventory, but I discovered in pointing
out to the new man his wrong attitudes and actions that I was really
taking my own inventory, and that if I expected him to change I would
have to work on myself too. This change has been a long, slow process
for me, but through these latter years the dividends have been
tremendous.

In June, 1945, with another member, I made my first---and only---Twelfth
Step call on a female alcoholic and a year later I married her. She has
been sober all the way through and for me that has been good. We can
share in the laughter and tears of our many friends, and most important,
we can share our A.A. way of life and are given a daily opportunity to
help others.

In conclusion, I can only say that whatever growth or understanding has
come to me, I have no wish to graduate. Very rarely do I miss the
meetings of my

neighborhood A.A. group, and my average has never been less than two
meetings a week. I have served on only one committee in the past nine
years, for I feel that I had my chance the first few years and that
newer members should fill the jobs. They are far more alert and
progressive than we floundering fathers were, and the future of our
fellowship is in their hands. We now live in the West and are very
fortunate in our area A.A.; it is good, simple and friendly, and our one
desire is to stay in A.A. and not on it. Our pet slogan is "Easy Does
It."

And I still say that as long as I remember that January 8th in
Washington, that is how long, by the grace of God as I understand Him, I
will retain a happy sobriety.

This physician, the originator of A.A.'s first colored group, but badly
caught in the toils, tells of his release and of how freedom came as he
worked among his own people.

I WAS BORN in a little town in Virginia in an average religious home. My
father, a negro, was a country physician. I remember in my early youth
my mother dressed me just as she did my two sisters, and I wore curls
until I was six years of age. At that time I started school and that's
how I got rid of the curls. I found that even then I had fears and
inhibitions. We lived just a few doors from the First Baptist Church and
when they had funerals I remember very often asking my mother whether
the person was good or bad and whether they were going to heaven or
hell. I was about six then.

My mother had been recently converted and, actually, had become a
religious fanatic. That was her main neurotic manifestation. She was
very possessive with us children. Another thing that mother drilled into
me was a very Puritanical point of view as to sex relations, and as to
motherhood and womanhood. I'm sure my ideas as to what life should be
like were quite different from that of the average person with whom I
associated. Later on in life that took its toll. I realize that now.

About this time an incident took place in grade school that I have never
forgotten because it made me realize that I was actually a physical
coward. During recess we were playing basketball and I had accidentally
tripped a fellow just a little larger than I was. He took the basketball
and smashed me in the face with it. That was enough provocation to fight
but I didn't fight, and I realized after recess why I didn't. It was
fear. That hurt and disturbed me a great deal.

Mother was of the old school and figured that anyone I associated with
should be of the proper type. Of course, in my day, times had changed;
she just hadn't changed with the times. I don't know whether it was
right or wrong, but at least I know that people weren't thinking the
same. We weren't even permitted to play cards in our home, but father
would give us just a little toddy with whiskey and sugar and warm water
now and then. We had no whiskey in the house, other than my father's
private stock. I've never seen him drunk in my life, although he'd take
a shot in the morning and usually one in the evening, and so did I; but
for the most part he kept his whiskey in his office. The only time that
I have ever seen my mother take anything alcoholic was around Christmas
time, when she would drink some eggnog or light wine.

I remember in my first year in high school, that mother suggested that I
do not join the cadet unit. She got a medical certificate so that I
should not have to join it. I don't know whether she was a pacifist or
whether she just thought that in the event of another war it would have
some bearing on my joining up.

About then too, I realized that my point of view on the opposite sex
wasn't entirely like that of most of the

boys I knew. For that reason, I believe, I married at a much younger age
than I would have, had it not been for my home training. My wife and I
have been married for some thirty years now. She was the first girl that
I ever took out. I had quite a heartache about her then because she
wasn't the type of girl that my mother wanted me to marry. In the first
place, she had been married before; I was her second husband. My mother
resented it so that the first Christmas after our marriage, which was in
May of 1923, she didn't even invite us to dinner. After our first child
came my parents both became allies, but in later days, after I became an
alcoholic, they both turned against me.

My father had come out of the South and had suffered a great deal down
there. He wanted to give me the very best and he thought that nothing
but being a doctor would suffice. On the other hand, I believe that I've
always been medically inclined, though I have never been able to see
medicine quite as the average person sees it. I do surgery because
that's something that you can see; it's more tangible. But I can
remember in post graduate days, and during internship, that very often
I'd go to a patient's bed and start a process of elimination and then,
very often, I'd wind up guessing. That wasn't the way it was with my
father. I think, with him it possibly was a gift---intuitive diagnosis.
Father, through the years, had built up a very good mail order business
because, at that time, there wasn't too much money in medicine.

I don't think I suffered too much as far as the racial situation was
concerned because I was born into it and knew nothing other than that. A
man wasn't actually mistreated, though if he was he could only resent
it.

He could do nothing about it. On the other hand, I got quite a different
picture farther south. Economic conditions had a great deal to do with
it, because I've often heard my father say that his mother would take
one of the old time flour sacks and cut a hole through the bottom and
two corners of it and there you'd have a gown. Of course, when father
finally came to Virginia to work his way through school, he resented the
southern "cracker," as he often called them, so much that he didn't even
go back to his mother's funeral. He said he never wanted to set foot in
the deep south again and he didn't.

I went to elementary and high school in Washington, D.C. and then to
Howard University. My internship was in Washington. I never had too much
trouble in school. I was able to get my work out. All my troubles arose
when I was thrown socially among groups of people. As far as school was
concerned, I made fair grades throughout.

This was around 1935, and it was about this time that I actually started
drinking. During the years 1930 to 1935, due to the Depression and its
aftermath, business went from bad to worse. I had my own medical
practice in Washington at that time, but the practice slackened and the
mail order business started to fall off. Dad, due to having spent most
of his time in a small Virginia town, didn't have any too much money,
and the money he had saved and the property he had acquired were in
Washington. He was in his late fifties, and all that he had undertaken
fell upon my shoulders at his death in 1928. For the first couple of
years it wasn't too bad because the momentum kept things going. But when
things became crucial,

everything started going haywire and I started going haywire with them.
At this point I believe I had only been intoxicated on maybe three or
four occasions, and certainly whiskey was no problem to me.

My father had purchased a restaurant, which he felt would take up some
of my spare time, and that's how I met Vi. She came in for her dinner.
I'd known her five or six months. To get rid of me one evening, she
decided to go to the movies, she and another friend. A very good friend
of mine who owned a drug store across the street from us, came by only
about two hours later and said that he had seen Vi down town. I said
that she told me she was going to the movies, and I became foolishly
disturbed about it and, as things snowballed, I decided to go out and
get drunk. That's the first time I was ever really drunk in my life. The
fear of the loss of Vi and the feeling that, though she had the right to
do as she pleased, she should have told me the truth about it, upset me.
That was my trouble. I thought that all women should be perfect.

I don't think I actually started to drink pathologically until
approximately 1935. About that time I had lost practically all my
property except the place we were living in. Things had just gone from
bad to worse. It meant that I had to give up a lot of the things that I
had been accustomed to and that wasn't the easiest thing in the world
for me. I think that was basically the thing that started me drinking in
1935. I started drinking alone then. I'd go into my home with a bottle,
and I remember clearly how I would look around to see if Vi was
watching. Something should have told me then that things were haywire. I
can remember her watching. There came a time when

she spoke to me about it, and I would say that I had a bad cold or that
I wasn't feeling well. That went on for maybe two months, and then she
got after me again about drinking. At that time the repeal whiskies were
back, and I'd go to the store and buy my whiskey and take it to my
office and put it under the desk, first in one place and then in
another, and there soon was an accumulation of empty bottles. My
brother-in-law was living with us at that time and I said to Vi, "Maybe
the bottles are brother's. I don't know. Ask him about it. I don't know
anything about the bottles." I actually wanted a drink, besides feeling
that I had to have a drink. From that point on, it's just the average
drinker's story.

I got to the place where I'd look forward to the week-end's drinking and
pacify myself by saying that the week-ends were mine, that it didn't
interfere with my family or with my business if I drank on the
week-ends. But the week-ends stretched on into Mondays, and the time
soon came when I drank every day. My practice at that juncture was just
barely getting us a living.

A peculiar thing happened in 1940. That year, on a Friday night, a man
whom I had known for years came to my office. My father had treated him
many years prior to this. This man's wife had been suffering for a
couple of months and when he came in he owed me a little bill. I filled
a prescription for him. The following day, Saturday, he came back and
said, "Jim, I owe you for that prescription last night. I didn't pay
you." I thought, "I know you didn't pay me, because you didn't get a
prescription." He said, "Yes. You know the prescription that you gave me
for my wife

last night." Fear gripped me then, because I could remember nothing
about it. It was the first blackout I had to recognize as a blackout.
The next morning I carried another prescription to this man's house and
exchanged it for the bottle his wife had. Then I said to my wife,
"Something has to be done." I took that bottle of medicine and gave it
to a very good friend of mine who was a pharmacist and had it analyzed,
and the bottle was perfectly all right. But I knew at that point that I
couldn't stop and I knew that I was a danger to myself and to others.

I had a long talk with a psychiatrist, but nothing came of that, and I
had also, just about that time, talked with a minister for whom I had a
great deal of respect. He went into the religious side and told me that
I didn't attend church as regularly as I should, and that he felt, more
or less, that this was responsible for my trouble. I rebelled against
this, because just about the time that I was getting ready to leave high
school, a revelation came to me about God and it made things very
complicated for me. The thought came to me that if God, as my mother
said, was a vengeful God, he couldn't be a loving God. I wasn't able to
comprehend it. I rebelled, and from that time on I don't think I
attended church more than a dozen times.

After this incident in 1940, I sought some other means of livelihood. I
had a very good friend who was in the Government service, and I went to
him about a job. He got me one. I worked for the Government about a year
and still maintained my evening office practice when the Government
agencies were decentralized. Then I went South, because they told me
that the particular county I was going to in North

Carolina was a dry county. I thought that this would be a big help to
me. I would meet some new faces and be in a dry county.

But I found that after I got to North Carolina it wasn't any different.
The State was different, but I wasn't. Nevertheless, I stayed sober
there about six months, because I knew that Vi was to come later and
bring the children. We had two girls and a boy at that time. Something
happened. Vi had secured work in Washington. She also was in the
Government service. I started inquiring where I could get a drink and,
of course, I found that it wasn't hard. I think whiskey was cheaper
there than it was in Washington. Matters got worse all the time until
finally they got so bad that I was reinvestigated by the Government.
Being an alcoholic, slick, and having some good sense left, I survived
the investigation. Then I had my first bad stomach hemorrhage. I was out
of work for about four days. I got into a lot of financial difficulties
too. I borrowed five hundred dollars from the bank and three hundred
from the loan shop, and I drank that up pretty fast. Then I decided that
I'd go back to Washington, which I did.

My wife received me graciously, although she was living in a one room
with a kitchen affair. She'd been reduced to that. I promised that I was
going to do the right thing. We were now both working in the same
agency. I continued to drink. I got drunk one night in October, went to
sleep in the rain and woke up with pneumonia. Nevertheless, we continued
to work together and I continued to drink, but I guess, deep down within
her heart as well as within mine, we both knew I couldn't stop drinking.
Vi thought

I didn't want to stop. We had several fights and on one or two occasions
I struck her with my fist. She decided that she didn't want any more of
that. So she went to court and talked it over with the judge. They
cooked up a plan whereby she didn't have to be molested by me if she
didn't want to be.

I went back to my mother's for a few days until things cooled off,
because the District Attorney had put out a summons for me to come to
see him in his office. A policeman came to the door and asked for James
S., but there wasn't any James S. there. He came back several times.
Within about ten days I got locked up for being drunk and this same
policeman was in the station house as I was being booked. I had to put
up a three hundred dollar bond because he was carrying the same summons
around in his pocket for me. So I went down to talk to the District
Attorney, and the arrangement was made that I would go home to stay with
my mother, and that meant that Vi and I were separated. I continued to
work and continued to go to lunch with Vi, and none of our acquaintances
on the job knew that we had separated. Very often we rode to and from
work together, but being separated really galled me deep down.

The November following, I took a few days off after pay day to celebrate
my birthday on the 25th of the month. As usual I got drunk and lost the
money. Someone had taken it from me. That was the usual pattern. I
sometimes gave it to my mother and then I'd go back and hound her for
it. I was just about broke. I guess I had five or ten dollars in my
pocket. Anyhow, on the 24th, after drinking all day on the 23rd, I must
have decided I wanted to see my wife

and have some kind of reconciliation or at least talk with her. I don't
remember whether I went by streetcar, whether I walked or went in a
taxicab. The one thing I can remember now was that Vi was on the corner
of 8th and L, and I remember vividly that she had an envelope in her
hand. I remember talking to her, but what happened after that I don't
know. What actually happened was that I had taken a penknife and stabbed
Vi three times with it. Then I left and went home to bed. Around eight
or nine o'clock there came two big detectives and a policeman to arrest
me for assault; and I was the most amazed person in the world when they
said I had assaulted someone, and especially that I had assaulted my
wife. I was taken to the station house and locked up. The next morning I
went up for arraignment. Vi was very kind and explained to the jury that
I was basically a fine fellow and a good husband, but that I drank too
much and that she thought I had lost my mind and felt that I should be
committed to an asylum. The judge said that if she felt that way he
would confine me for thirty days' examination and observation. There was
no observation. There might have been some investigation. The closest I
came to a psychiatrist during that time was an intern who came to take
blood tests. After the trial, I got big-hearted again and felt that I
should do something in payment for Vi's kindness to me; so I left
Washington and went to Seattle to work. I was there about three weeks,
and then I got restless and started to tramp across the country, here
and there, until I finally wound up in Pennsylvania, in a steel mill.

I worked in the steel mill for possibly two months,

and then I became disgusted with myself and decided to go back home. I
think the thing that galled me was that just after Easter I had drawn my
salary for two weeks' work and had decided that I was going to send some
money to Vi; and above all else I was going to send my baby daughter an
Easter outfit. But there happened to be a liquor store between the post
office and the mill, and I stopped to get that one drink. Of course the
kid never got the Easter outfit. I got very little out of the two
hundred, that I drew on that pay day.

I knew I wasn't capable of keeping the bulk of the money myself, so I
gave it to a white fellow who owned the bar which I frequented. He kept
the money for me, but I worried him to death for it. Finally, I broke
the last one hundred dollar bill the Saturday before I left. I got out
of that bill one pair of shoes, and the rest of that money was blown. I
took the last to buy my railroad ticket.

I'd been home about a week or ten days when one of my friends asked if I
could repair one of his electrical outlets. Thinking only of two or
three dollars to buy some whiskey, I did the job and that's how I met
Ella G., who was responsible for my coming into A.A. I went to this
friend's shop to repair his electrical outlet and I noticed this lady.
She continued to watch me, although she didn't say anything. Finally she
said, "Isn't your name Jim S.?" I said, "Yes." Then she told me who she
was. She was Ella G. When I had known her years before she was rather
slender, but at this time she weighed as much as she does now, which is
up around in the two hundreds or very close to it. I had not recognized
her, but as soon as she said

who she was I remembered her right away. She didn't say anything about
A.A. or Charlie G. my sponsor at that time, but she did ask about Vi,
and I told her Vi was working and how she could locate her. It was
around noon, a day or two later, when the telephone rang and it was
Ella. She asked me if I would let someone come up and talk to me
concerning a business deal. She never mentioned anything about my
whiskey drinking because if she had I would have told her, "No" right
then. I asked her just what this deal was, but she wouldn't say. She
said, "He has something of interest, if you will see him." I told her
that I would. She asked me one other thing. She asked me if I would try
to be sober if I possibly could. So I put forth some effort that day to
try to stay sober if I could, though my sobriety was just a daze.

About seven that evening my sponsor walked in, Charlie G. He didn't seem
too much at ease in the beginning. I guess I felt, and he sensed it,
that I wanted him to hurry up and say what he had to say and get out.
Anyhow, he started talking about himself. He started telling me how much
trouble he had, and I said to myself, "I wonder why this guy is telling
me all his troubles. I have troubles of my own." Finally, he brought in
the angle of whiskey. He continued to talk and I to listen. After he'd
talked half an hour, I still wanted him to hurry up and get out so I
could go and get some whiskey before the liquor store closed. But as he
continued to talk, I realized that this was the first time I had met a
person who had the same problems I did and who, I sincerely believe,
understood me as an individual. I knew my wife didn't because I had been
sincere in all my promises to her

as well as to my mother and to my close friends, but the urge to take
that drink was more powerful than anything else.

After Charlie had talked a while, I knew that this man had something. In
that short period he built within me something that I had long since
lost, which was hope. When he left I walked with him to the streetcar
line, which was just about a half a block, but there were two liquor
stores, one on each corner from my home. I put Charlie on the car and
when I left him I passed both of those liquor stores without even
thinking about them.

The following Sunday we met at Ella G.'s. It was Charlie and three or
four others. That was the next meeting, and the first meeting of a
colored group in A.A., so far as I know. We held some two or three
meetings at Ella's home and from there we held some two or three at her
mother's home. Then Charlie or someone in the group suggested that we
try to get a place in a church or hall to hold meetings. I approached
several ministers and all of them thought it was a very good idea, but
they never relinquished any space. So, finally, I went to the YMCA and
they graciously permitted us to use a room at two dollars a night. At
that time we had our meetings on Friday nights. Of course, it wasn't
very much of a meeting in the beginning; most of the time it was just Vi
and myself. But, finally, we got one or two to come in and stick and
from there, of course, we started to grow.

I haven't mentioned it, but Charlie, my sponsor, was white, and when we
got our group started we got help from other white groups in Washington.
They came, many of them, and stuck by us and told us how

to hold meetings. They taught us a great deal about Twelve Step work
too. Indeed, without their aid we couldn't possibly have gone on. They
saved us endless time and lost motion. And, not only that, but they gave
us financial help. Even when we were paying that two dollars a night,
they often paid it for us because our collection was so small.

At this time I wasn't working. Vi was taking care of me and I was
devoting all my time to the building of that group. I worked at that
alone for six months. I just gathered up this and that alcoholic,
because, in the back of my mind, I wanted to save all the world. I had
found this new "something," and I wanted to give it to everyone who had
a problem. We didn't save the world, but we did manage to help some
individuals.

That's my story of what A.A. has done for me.

## Fear

He spent eighteen years in running away; and then found he didn't have
to run. So he started A.A. in Detroit.

FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS, from the age of twenty-one to thirty-nine, fear
governed my life. By the time I was thirty I had found that alcohol
dissolved fear. For a little while. In the end I had two problems
instead of one: Fear and alcohol.

I came from a good family. I believe the sociologists would call it
"upper middle class." By the time I was twenty-one I had had six years
of life in foreign countries, spoke three languages fluently, and had
attended college for two years. A low ebb in the family fortunes
necessitated my going to work when I was twenty. I entered the business
world with every confidence that success lay ahead of me. I had been
brought up to believe this, and I had shown during my 'teens
considerable enterprise and imagination about earning money. To the best
of my recollection I was completely free from any abnormal fears.
Vacations from school and from work, spelled "travel" to me---and I
traveled with gusto. During my first year out of college I had endless
dates, and went to countless dances, balls and dinner parties.

Suddenly all this changed. I underwent a shattering nervous breakdown.
Three months in bed. Three more months of being up and around the house
for brief periods and in bed the rest of the time. Visits

from friends which lasted over fifteen minutes exhausted me. A complete
checkup at one of the best hospitals revealed nothing. I heard for the
first time an expression which I was to grow to loathe: "There is
nothing organically wrong." Psychiatry might have helped, but
psychiatrists had not penetrated the middle west.

Spring came. I went for my first walk. Half a block from my house, I
tried to turn the corner. Fear froze me in my tracks, but the instant I
turned back toward home this paralyzing fear left me. This was the
beginning of an unending series of such experiences. I told our family
doctor, an understanding man who gave hours of his time trying to help
me, about this experience. He told me that it was imperative that I walk
around the entire block, cost me what it might in mental agony. I
carried out his instructions. When I reached a point directly back of
our house, where I could have cut through a friend's garden, I was
almost overpowered by the desire to get home, but I made the whole
journey. Probably only a few readers of this story will be able, from
personal experiences of their own, to understand the exhilaration and
sense of accomplishment which I felt after finishing this seemingly
simple assignment.

The details of the long road back to something resembling normal
living---the first short streetcar ride, the purchase of a used bike
which enabled me to widen the narrow horizon of life, the first trip
downtown---I will not dwell on. I got an easy, part-time job selling
printing for a small neighborhood printer. This widened the scope of my
activities. A year later I was able to buy a Model T roadster and take a
better

job with a downtown printer. From this job and the next one with another
printer I was courteously dismissed. I simply did not have the pep to do
hard, "cold-turkey" selling. I switched into real estate brokerage and
property management work. Almost simultaneously, I discovered that
cocktails in the late afternoon and highballs in the evening relieved
the many tensions of the day. This happy combination of pleasant work
and alcohol lasted for five years. Of course, the latter ultimately
killed the former, but of this, more anon.

All this changed when I was thirty years old. My parents died, both in
the same year, leaving me, a sheltered and somewhat immature man, on my
own. I moved into a "bachelor hall." These men all drank on Saturday
nights, and enjoyed themselves. My pattern of drinking became very
different from theirs. I had bad nervous headaches, particularly at the
base of my neck. Liquor relieved these. At last I discovered alcohol as
a cure-all. I joined their Saturday night parties and enjoyed myself
too. But---I also stayed up week nights after they had retired and drank
myself into bed. My thinking about drinking had undergone a great
change. Liquor had become a crutch on the one hand and a means of
retreat from life on the other.

The ensuing nine years were the Depression years, both nationally and
personally. With the bravery born of desperation, and abetted by
alcohol, I married a young and lovely girl. Our marriage lasted four
years. At least three of those four years must have been a living hell
for my wife, because she had to watch the man she loved disintegrate
morally, mentally and

financially. The birth of a baby boy did nothing toward staying the
downward spiral. When she finally took the baby and left, I locked
myself in the house and stayed drunk for a month.

The next two years were simply a long drawn out process of less and less
work and more and more whiskey. I ended up, homeless, jobless, penniless
and rudderless, as the problem guest of a close friend whose family was
out of town. Haunting me through each day's stupor---and there were
eighteen or nineteen such days in this man's home---was the thought:
"Where do I go when his family comes home?" When the day of their return
was almost upon me, and suicide was the only answer I had been able to
think of, I went into Ralph's room one evening and told him the truth.
He was a man of considerable means and he might have done what many men
would have done in such a case. He might have handed me fifty dollars
and said that I ought to pull myself together and make a new start. I
have thanked God many times in the last sixteen years that that was just
what he did not do!

Instead, he got dressed, took me out, bought me three or four double
shots and put me to bed. The next day he turned me over to a couple who,
although neither was an alcoholic, knew Dr. Bob and were willing to
drive me to Akron where they would turn me over to his care. The only
stipulation they made was this: I had to make the decision myself. What
decision? The choice was limited. To go north into the empty pine
country and shoot myself, or to go south in the faint hope that a bunch
of strangers might help me with my drinking problem. Well, suicide was a
last straw matter, and I had not drawn the last straw

yet. So I was driven to Akron the very next day by these Good
Samaritans, and turned over to Dr. Bob and the then tiny Akron Group.

Here, while in a hospital bed, men with clear eyes, happy faces, and a
look of assurance and purposefulness about them, came to see me and told
me their stories. Some of these were hard to believe, but it did not
require a giant brain to perceive that they had something I could use.
How could I get it? It was simple, they said, and went on to explain to
me in their own language the program of recovery and daily living which
we know today as the Twelve Steps of A.A. Dr. Bob dwelt at length on how
prayer had given him release, time and time again, from the nearly
overpowering compulsion to take a drink. He it was who convinced me,
because his own conviction was so real, that a Power greater than myself
could help me in the crises of life, and that the means of communicating
with this Power was simple prayer. Here was a tall, rugged, highly
educated Yankee talking in a matter of course way about God and prayer.
If he and these other fellows could do it, so could I.

When I got out of the hospital, I was invited to stay with Dr. Bob and
his dear wife, Anne. I was suddenly and uncontrollably seized with the
old, paralyzing panic. The hospital had seemed so safe. Now I was in a
strange house, in a strange city, and fear gripped me. I shut myself in
my room, which began to go around in circles. Panic, confusion and chaos
were supreme. Out of this maelstrom just two coherent thoughts came to
the surface; one, a drink would mean homelessness and death; two, I
could no longer relieve the pressure of fear by starting home, as was
once my

habitual solution to this problem, because I no longer had a home.
Finally, and I shall never know how much later it was, one clear thought
came to me: Try prayer. You can't lose, and maybe God will help
you---just maybe, mind you. Having no one else to turn to, I was willing
to give Him a chance, although with considerable doubt. I got down on my
knees for the first time in thirty years. The prayer I said was simple.
It went something like this: "God, for eighteen years I have been unable
to handle this problem. Please let me turn it over to you."

Immediately a great feeling of peace descended upon me, intermingled
with a feeling of being suffused with a quiet strength. I lay down on
the bed and slept like a child. An hour later I awoke to a new world.
Nothing had changed and yet everything had changed. The scales had
dropped from my eyes and I could see life in its proper perspective. I
had tried to be the center of my own little world, whereas God was the
center of a vast universe of which I was perhaps an essential, but a
very tiny, part.

It is well over sixteen years since I came back to life. I have never
had a drink since. This alone is a miracle. It is, however, only the
first of a series of miracles which have followed one another as a
result of my trying to apply to my daily life the principles embodied in
our Twelve Steps. I would like to sketch for you the highlights of these
sixteen years of a slow but steady and satisfying upward climb.

Poor health and a complete lack of money necessitated my remaining with
Dr. Bob and Anne for very close to a year. It would be impossible for me
to pass over this year without mentioning my love for, and my

indebtedness to these two wonderful people who are no longer with us.
They made me feel as if I were a part of their family, and so did their
children. The example which they and Bill W., whose visits to Akron were
fairly frequent, set me of service to their fellow men imbued me with a
great desire to emulate them. Sometimes during that year I rebelled
inwardly at what seemed like lost time, and at having to be a burden to
these good people whose means were limited. Long before I had any real
opportunity to give, I had to learn the equally important lesson of
receiving graciously.

During my first few months in Akron I was quite sure that I never wanted
to see my home town again. Too many economic and social problems would
beset me there. I would make a fresh start somewhere else. After six
months of sobriety I saw the picture in a different light: Detroit was
the place I had to return to, not only because I must face the mess I
had made there, but because it was there that I could be of the most
service to A.A. In the spring of 1939, Bill stopped off in Akron on his
way to Detroit on business. I jumped at the suggestion that I accompany
him. We spent two days there together before he returned to New York.
Friends invited me to stay on for as long as I cared to. I remained with
them for three weeks, using part of the time in making many amends,
which I had had no earlier opportunity of making.

The rest of my time was devoted to A.A. spadework. I wanted "ripe"
prospects and I didn't feel that I would get very far chasing individual
drunks in and out of bars. So I spent much of my time calling on the
people who I felt would logically come in contact

with alcoholic cases, doctors, ministers, lawyers and the personnel men
in industry. I also talked A.A. to every friend who would listen, at
lunch, at dinner, on street corners. A doctor tipped me off to my first
prospect. I landed him and shipped him by train to Akron, with a pint of
whiskey in his pocket to keep him from wanting to get off the train in
Toledo! Nothing has ever to this day equaled the thrill of that first
case.

Those three weeks left me completely exhausted and I had to return to
Akron for three more months of rest. While there, two or three more
"cash customers" (as Dr. Bob used to call them---probably because they
had so little cash) were shipped in to us from Detroit. When I finally
returned to Detroit to find work and to learn to stand on my own feet,
the ball was already rolling, however slowly. But it took six more
months of work and disappointments before a group of three men got
together in my rooming house bedroom for their first A.A. meeting.

It sounds simple, but there were obstacles and doubts to overcome. I
well remember a session I had with myself soon after I returned. It ran
something like this: If I go around shouting from the rooftops about my
alcoholism, it might very possibly prevent me from getting a good job.
But---supposing that just one man died because I had, for selfish
reasons, kept my mouth shut? No. I was supposed to be doing God's will,
not mine. His road lay clear before me, and I'd better quit
rationalizing myself into any detours. I could not expect to keep what I
had gained unless I gave it away.

The Depression was still on and jobs were scarce. My health was still
uncertain. So I created a job for

myself selling women's hosiery and men's made-to-order shirts. This gave
me the freedom to do A.A. work, and to rest for periods of two or three
days when I became too exhausted to carry on. There was more than one
occasion when I got up in the morning with just enough money for coffee
and toast and the bus fare to carry me to my first appointment. No
sale---no lunch. During that first year, however, I managed to make both
ends meet, and to avoid ever going back to my old habit ends meet, and
to avoid ever going back to my old habit pattern of borrowing money when
I could not earn it. Here by itself was a great step forward.

During the first three months I carried on all these activities without
a car, depending entirely on buses and streetcars---I, who had always to
have a car at my immediate command. I, who had never made a speech in my
life and who would have been frightened sick at the prospect, stood up
in front of Rotary groups in different parts of the city and talked
about Alcoholics Anonymous. I, carried away with the desire to serve
A.A., gave what was probably one of the first radio broadcasts about
A.A., living through a case of mike fright and feeling like a million
dollars when it was all over. I lived through a week of the fidgets
because I had agreed to address a group of alcoholic inmates in one of
our state mental hospitals. There was the same reward---exhilaration at
a mission accomplished. Do I have to tell you who gained the most out of
all this?

Within a year of my return to Detroit, A.A. was a definitely established
little group of about a dozen members and I too was established in a
modest but steady job handling an independent dry-cleaning route of my
own. I was my own boss. It took five years of A.A. living, and a
substantial improvement in my

health, before I could take a full-time office job where someone else
was boss.

This office job brought me face to face with a problem which I had
sidestepped all my adult life, lack of training. This time I did
something about it. I enrolled in a correspondence school which taught
nothing but accounting. With this specialized training, and a liberal
business education in the school of hard knocks, I was able to set up
shop some two years later as an independent accountant. Seven years of
work in this field brought an opportunity to affiliate myself actively
with one of my clients, a fellow A.A. We complement each other
beautifully, as he is a born salesman and my taste is for finance and
management. At long last I am doing the kind of work I have always
wanted to do, but never had the patience and emotional stability to
train myself for. The A.A. program showed me the way to come down to
earth, start from the bottom and work up. This represents another great
change for me. In the long ago past I used to start at the top as
president or treasurer and end up with the sheriff breathing down my
neck.

So much for my business life. Obviously I have overcome fear to a
sufficient degree to think in terms of success in business. With God's
help I am able, for one day at a time, to carry business
responsibilities which, not many years ago, I would not have dreamed of
assuming. But what about my social life? What about those fears which
once paralyzed me to the point of my becoming a semi-hermit? What about
my fear of travel?

It would be wonderful were I able to tell you that my confidence in God
and my application of the

Twelve Steps to my daily living have utterly banished fear. But this
would not be the truth. The most accurate answer I can give you is this:
Fear has never again ruled my life since that day in September, 1938,
when I found that a Power greater than myself could not only restore me
to sanity but could keep me both sober and sane. Never in sixteen years
have I dodged anything because I was afraid of it. I have faced life
instead of running away from it.

Some of the things which used to stop me in my tracks from fear still
make me nervous in the anticipation of their doing, but once I kick
myself into doing them nervousness disappears and I enjoy myself. In
recent years I have had the happy combination of time and money to
travel occasionally. I am very apt to get into quite an uproar for a day
or two before starting, but I do start, and once started, I have a swell
time.

Have I ever wanted a drink during these years? Only once did I suffer
from a nearly overpowering compulsion to take a drink. Oddly enough, the
circumstances and surroundings were pleasant. I was at a beautifully set
dinner table. I was in a perfectly happy frame of mind. I had been in
A.A. a year, and the last thing in my mind was a drink. There was a
glass of sherry at my place. I was seized with an almost uncontrollable
desire to reach out for it. I shut my eyes and asked for help. In
fifteen seconds or less, the feeling passed. There have also been
numerous times when I have thought about taking a drink. Such thinking
usually began with thoughts of the pleasant drinking of my youth. I
learned early in my A.A. life that I could not afford to fondle such
thoughts, as you might fondle a pet, because this particular pet could

grow into a monster. Instead, I quickly substitute one or another vivid
scene from the nightmare of my later drinking.

Twenty-odd years ago I made a mess out of my one and only marriage. It
was therefore not extraordinary that I should shy away from any serious
thought of marriage for a great many years after joining A.A. Here was
something requiring a greater willingness to assume responsibility, and
a larger degree of cooperation and "give and take" than even business
requires of one. However, I must have felt, deep down inside myself,
that living the selfish life of a bachelor was only half living. By
living alone you can pretty much eliminate grief from your life, but you
also eliminate joy. At any rate the last great step toward a well
rounded life still lay ahead of me. So six months ago I acquired a ready
made family consisting of one charming wife, four grown children to whom
I am devoted, and three grandchildren. Being an alcoholic, I couldn't
dream of doing anything by halves! My wife, a sister member in A.A., had
been a widow nine years and I had been single eighteen years. The
adjustments in such a case are difficult and take time, but we both feel
that they are certainly worth it. We are both depending upon God and our
use of the A.A. program to help us make a success of this joint
undertaking.

It is undoubtedly too soon for me to say how much of a success I shall
be as a husband in time to come. I do feel, though, that the fact that I
finally grew up to a point where I could even tackle such a job is the
apex of the story of a man who spent eighteen years running away from
life.

## Short

But he found that there was a Higher Power which had more faith in him
than he had in himself. Thus, A.A. was born in Chicago.

I GREW up in a small town outside Akron, Ohio, where the life was
typical of any average small town. I was very much interested in
athletics, and because of this and parental influence, I didn't drink or
smoke in either grade or high school.

All of this changed when I went to college. I had to adapt to new
associations and associates, and it seemed to be the smart thing to
drink and smoke. I confined drinking to weekends and drank normally in
college and for several years thereafter.

After I left school, I went to work in Akron, living at home with my
parents. Homelife was again a restraining influence. When I drank, I hid
it from my folks out of respect for their feelings. This continued until
I was twenty-seven. Then I started traveling, with the United States and
Canada as my territory, and with so much freedom and with an unlimited
expense account, I was soon drinking every night and kidding myself that
it was all part of the job. I know now that sixty percent of the time I
drank alone without benefit of customers.

In 1930, I moved to Chicago. Shortly thereafter, aided by the
Depression, I found that I had a great

deal of spare time and that a little drink in the morning helped. By
1932, I was going on two or three day benders. That same year, my wife
became fed up with my drinking around the house and called my dad in
Akron to come and pick me up. She asked him to do something about me
because she couldn't. She was thoroughly disgusted.

This was the beginning of five years of bouncing back and forth between
my home in Chicago and Akron to sober up. It was a period of binges
coming closer and closer together and being of longer duration. Once dad
came all the way to Florida to sober me up, after a hotel manager called
him and said that if he wanted to see me alive he better get there fast.
My wife could not understand why I would sober up for dad but not for
her. They went into a huddle and dad explained that he simply took my
pants, shoes and money away, so that I could get no liquor and had to
sober up.

One time my wife decided to try this too. After finding every bottle
that I had hidden around the apartment, she took away my pants, my
shoes, my money and my keys, threw them under the bed in the back
bedroom and slip-locked our door. By one a.m. I was desperate. I found
some wool stockings, some white flannels that had shrunk to my knees,
and an old jacket. I jimmied the front door so that I could get back in,
and walked out. I was hit by an icy blast. It was February with snow and
ice on the ground and I had a four block walk to the nearest cab stand,
but I made it. On my ride to the nearest bar, I sold the driver on how
misunderstood I was by my wife and what an unreasonable person she was.
By the time we

reached the bar, he was willing to buy me a quart with his own money.
Then when we got back to the apartment, he was willing to wait two or
three days until I got my health back to be paid off for the liquor and
fare. I was a good salesman. My wife could not understand the next
morning why I was drunker than the night before when she took my
bottles.

After a particularly bad Christmas and New Year's holiday, dad picked me
up again early in January, 1937, to go through the usual sobering up
routine. This consisted of walking the floor for three or four days and
nights until I could take nourishment. This time he had a suggestion to
offer. He waited until I was completely sober and the day before I was
to head back for Chicago, he told me of a small group of men in Akron
who apparently had the same problem that I had but were doing something
about it. He said they were sober, happy and had their self-respect back
as well as the respect of their neighbors. He mentioned two of them that
I had known through the years and suggested that I talk with them. But I
had my health back and besides, I reasoned, they were much worse than I
would ever be. Why, even a year ago, I had seen Howard, an ex-doctor,
mooching a dime for a drink. I could not possibly be that bad. I would
at least have asked for a quarter! So I told dad that I would lick it on
my own, that I would drink nothing for a month and after that only beer.

Several months later dad was back in Chicago to pick me up again, but
this time my attitude was entirely different. I could not wait to tell
him that I wanted help, that if these men in Akron had anything

I wanted it, and would do anything to get it. I was completely licked by
alcohol.

I can still remember very distinctly getting into Akron at eleven p.m.
and routing this same Howard out of bed to do something about me. He
spent two hours with me that night telling me his story. He said he had
finally learned that drinking was a fatal illness made up of an allergy
plus an obsession, and once the drinking had passed from habit to
obsession, we were completely hopeless, and could look forward only to
spending the balance of our lives in mental institutions or to death.

He laid great stress on the progression of his attitude toward life and
people, and most of his attitudes had been very similar to mine. I
thought at times that he was telling my story! I had thought that I was
completely different from other people, that I was beginning to become a
little balmy, even to the point of withdrawing more and more from
society and wanting to be alone with my bottle.

Here was a man with essentially the same outlook on life, except that he
had done something about it. He was happy, getting a kick out of life
and people, and beginning to get his medical practice back again. As I
look back on that first evening I realize that I began to hope, then,
for the first time; and I felt that if he could regain these things,
perhaps it would be possible for me too.

The next afternoon and evening, two other men visited me and each told
me his story and the things that they were doing to try to recover from
this tragic illness. They had that certain something that seemed to
glow, a peace and a serenity combined with happi-

ness. In the next two or three days the balance of this handful of men
contacted me, encouraged me, and told me how they were trying to live
this program of recovery and the fun they were having doing it.

Then and then only, after a thorough indoctrination by eight or nine
individuals, was I allowed to attend my first meeting. This first
meeting was held in the living room of a home and was led by Bill D.,
the first man that Bill W. and Dr. Bob had worked with successfully.

The meeting consisted of perhaps eight or nine alcoholics and seven or
eight wives. It was different from the meetings now held. The big A.A.
book had not been written and there was no literature except various
religious pamphlets. The program was carried on entirely by word of
mouth.

The meeting lasted an hour and closed with the Lord's Prayer. After it
was closed we all retired to the kitchen and had coffee and doughnuts
and more discussion until the small hours of the morning.

I was terribly impressed by this meeting and the quality of happiness
these men displayed, despite their lack of material means. In this small
group, during the Depression, there was no one who was not hard up.

I stayed in Akron two or three weeks on my initial trip trying to absorb
as much of the program and philosophy as possible. I spent a great deal
of time with Dr. Bob, whenever he had the time to spare, and in the
homes of two or three other people, trying to see how the family lived
the program. Every evening we would meet at the home of one of the
members and have coffee and doughnuts and spend a social evening.

The day before I was due to go back to Chicago, a

Wednesday and Dr. Bob's afternoon off, he had me down to the office and
we spent three or four hours formally going through the Six-Step program
as it was at that time. The six steps were:

1\. Complete deflation.

2\. Dependence and guidance from a Higher Power.

3\. Moral inventory.

4\. Confession.

5\. Restitution.

6\. Continued work with other alcoholics.

Dr. Bob led me through all of these steps. At the moral inventory, he
brought up some of my bad personality traits or character defects, such
as selfishness, conceit, jealousy, carelessness, intolerance,
ill-temper, sarcasm and resentments. We went over these at great length
and then he finally asked me if I wanted these defects of character
removed. When I said yes, we both knelt at his desk and prayed, each of
us asking to have these defects taken away.

This picture is still vivid. If I live to be a hundred, it will always
stand out in my mind. It was very impressive and I wish that every A.A.
could have the benefit of this type of sponsorship today. Dr. Bob always
emphasized the religious angle very strongly, and I think it helped. I
know it helped me. Dr. Bob then led me through the restitution step, in
which I made a list of all of the persons I had harmed, and worked out
ways and means of slowly making restitution.

I made several decisions at that time. One of them was that I would try
to get a group started in Chicago; the second was that I would have to
return to Akron to attend meetings at least every two months until I

did get a group started in Chicago; third, I decided I must place this
program above everything else, even my family, because if I did not
maintain my sobriety I would lose my family anyway. If I did not
maintain my sobriety, I would not have a job. If I did not maintain my
sobriety, I would have no friends left. I had few enough at that time.

The next day I went back to Chicago and started a vigorous campaign
among my so-called friends or drinking companions. Their answer was
always the same: If they should need it at any time they would surely
get in touch with me. I went to a minister and a doctor that I still
knew and they, in turn, asked me how long I had been sober. When I told
them six weeks, they were polite and said that they would contact me in
case they had anyone with an alcoholic problem.

Needless to say, it was a year or more before they did contact me. On my
trips back to Akron to get my spirits recharged and to work with other
alcoholics, I would ask Dr. Bob about this delay and wonder just what
was wrong with me. He would invariably reply, "When you are right and
the time is right, Providence will provide. You must always be willing
and continue to make contacts."

A few months after I made my original trip to Akron I was feeling pretty
cocky, and I didn't think my wife was treating me with proper respect,
now that I was an outstanding citizen. So I set out to get drunk
deliberately, just to teach her what she was missing. A week later, I
had to get an old friend from Akron to spend two days sobering me up.
That was my lesson, that one could not take the moral inventory and

then file it away; that the alcoholic has to continue to take inventory
every day if he expects to get well and stay well. That was my only
slip. It taught me a valuable lesson. In the summer of 1938, almost a
year from the time I made my original contact with Akron, the man for
whom I was working and who knew about the program, approached me and
asked if I could do anything about one of his salesmen who was drinking
very heavily. I went to the sanitarium where this chap was incarcerated
and found to my surprise that he was interested. He had been wanting to
do something about his drinking for a long time, but did not know how. I
spent several days with him, but I did not feel adequate to pass the
program on to him alone. So I suggested that he take a trip to Akron for
a couple of weeks, which he did, living with one of the A.A. families
there. When he returned, we had practically daily meetings from that
time on.

A few months later one of the men who had been in touch with the group
in Akron came to Chicago to live, and then there were three of us who
continued to have informal meetings quite regularly.

In the spring of 1939, the Big Book was printed, and we had two
inquiries from the New York office because of a fifteen-minute radio
talk that was made. Neither one of the two was interested for himself,
one being a mother who wanted to do something for her son. I suggested
to her that she should see the son's minister or doctor, and that
perhaps he would recommend the A.A. program.

The doctor, a young man, immediately took fire with the idea, and while
he did not convince the son, he turned over two prospects who were
anxious for

the program. The three of us did not feel up to the job, and after a few
meetings we convinced the prospects that they too should go to Akron
where they could see an older group in action.

In the meantime, another doctor in Evanston became convinced that the
program had possibilities, and turned over a woman to us to do something
about. The girl was full of enthusiasm and she made the trip to Akron
too. Immediately on her return we began to have formal meetings once a
week, in the autumn of 1939, and we have continued to do this and to
expand ever since.

Occasionally, it is accorded to a few of us to watch something fine grow
from a tiny kernel into something of gigantic goodness. Such has been my
privilege, both nationally and in my home city. From a mere handful in
Akron we have spread throughout the world. From a single member in the
Chicago area, commuting to Akron we now exceed six thousand.

These last eighteen years have been the happiest of my life, trite
though that statement may seem. Fifteen of those years I would not have
enjoyed had I continued drinking. Doctors told me before I stopped that
I had only three years at the outside to live.

This latest part of my life has had a purpose, not in great things
accomplished but in daily living. Courage to face each day has replaced
the fears and uncertainties of earlier years. Acceptance of things as
they are has replaced the old impatient champing at the bit to conquer
the world. I have stopped tilting at windmills, and instead have tried
to accomplish the little daily tasks, unimportant in themselves, but
tasks that are an integral part of living fully.

Where derision, contempt and pity were once shown me, I now enjoy the
respect of many people. Where once I had casual acquaintances, all of
whom were fair weather friends, I now have a host of friends who accept
me for what I am. And over my A.A. years I have made many real, honest,
sincere friendships that I shall always cherish.

I'm rated as a modestly successful man. My stock of material goods isn't
great. But I have a fortune in friendships, courage, self assurance and
honest appraisal of my own abilities. Above all, I have gained the
greatest thing accorded to any man, the love and understanding of a
gracious God, who has lifted me from the alcoholic scrap-heap to a
position of trust where I have been able to reap the rich rewards that
come from showing a little love for others and from serving them as I
can.

## Kingdom

This worldly lady helped to develop A.A. in Chicago and thus passed her
keys to many.

A LITTLE MORE than fifteen years ago, through a long and calamitous
series of shattering experiences, I found myself being helplessly
propelled toward total destruction. I was without power to change the
course my life had taken. How I had arrived at this tragic impasse I
could not have explained to anyone. I was thirty-three years old and my
life was spent. I was caught in a cycle of alcohol and sedation that was
proving inescapable and consciousness had become intolerable.

I was a product of the post-war prohibition era of the roaring '20's.
That age of the flapper and the "It" girl, speakeasies and the hip
flask, the boyish bob and the drugstore cowboy, John Held Jr. and F.
Scott Fitzgerald, all generously sprinkled with a patent
pseudo-sophistication. To be sure, this had been a dizzy and confused
interval, but most everyone else I knew had emerged from it with both
feet on the ground and a fair amount of adult maturity.

Nor could I blame my dilemma on my childhood environment. I couldn't
have chosen more loving and conscientious parents. I was given every
advantage in a well-ordered home. I had the best schools, summer camps,
resort vacations and travel. Every reason-

able desire was possible of attainment for me. I was strong and healthy
and quite athletic.

I experienced some of the pleasure of social drinking when I was
sixteen. I definitely liked it, everything about it, the taste, the
effects; and I realize now that a drink did something for me or to me
that was different from the way it affected others. It wasn't long
before any party without drinks was a dud for me.

I was married at twenty, had two children and was divorced at
twenty-three. My broken home and broken heart fanned my smoldering
self-pity into a fair-sized bonfire and this kept me well supplied with
reasons for having another drink, and then another.

At twenty-five I had developed an alcoholic problem. I began making the
rounds of the doctors in the hope that one of them might find some cure
for my accumulating ailments, preferably something that could be removed
surgically.

Of course the doctors found nothing. Just an unstable woman,
undisciplined, poorly adjusted and filled with nameless fears. Most of
them prescribed sedatives and advised rest and moderation.

Between the ages of twenty-five and thirty I tried everything. I moved a
thousand miles away from home to Chicago and a new environment. I
studied art; I desperately endeavored to create an interest in many
things, in a new place among new people. Nothing worked. My drinking
habits increased in spite of my struggle for control. I tried the beer
diet, the wine diet, timing, measuring, and spacing of drinks. I tried
them mixed, unmixed, drinking only when gay, only when depressed. And
still by the time I was thirty years old I was being pushed around with

a compulsion to drink that was completely beyond my control. I couldn't
stop drinking. I would hang on to sobriety for short intervals, but
always there would come the tide of an overpowering necessity to drink
and, as I was engulfed in it, I felt such a sense of panic that I really
believed I would die if I didn't get that drink inside.

Needless to say, this was not pleasurable drinking. I had long since
given up any pretense of the "social" cocktail hour. This was drinking
in sheer desperation, alone and locked behind my own door. Alone in the
relative safety of my home because I knew I dare not risk the danger of
blacking out in some public place or at the wheel of a car. I could no
longer gage my capacity and it might be the second or the tenth drink
that would erase my consciousness.

The next three years saw me in sanitariums, once in a ten day coma, from
which I very nearly did not recover, in and out of hospitals or confined
at home with day and night nurses. By now I wanted to die, but had lost
the courage even to take my life. I was trapped, and for the life of me
I did not know how or why this had happened to me. And all the while my
fear fed a growing conviction that before long it would be necessary for
me to be put away in some institution. People didn't behave this way
outside of an asylum. Heartsickness, shame, and fear, fear bordering on
panic, and no complete escape any longer except in oblivion. Certainly
now, anyone would have agreed that only a miracle could prevent my final
breakdown. But how does one get a prescription for a miracle?

For about one year, prior to this time, there was one doctor who had
continued to struggle with me. He

had tried everything from having me attend daily mass at six a.m. to
performing the most menial labor for his charity patients. Why he
bothered with me as long as he did I shall never know, for he knew there
was no answer for me in medicine and he, like all doctors of his day,
had been taught that the alcoholic was incurable and should be ignored.
Doctors were advised to attend patients who could be benefited by
medicine. With the alcoholic, they could only give temporary relief and
in the last stages not even that. It was a waste of the doctors' time
and the patients' money. Nevertheless, there were a few doctors who saw
alcoholism as a disease and felt that the alcoholic was a victim of
something over which he had no control. They had a hunch that there must
be an answer for these apparently hopeless ones, somewhere. Fortunately
for me, my doctor was one of the enlightened.

And then, in the spring of 1939, a very remarkable book was rolled off a
New York press with the title "Alcoholics Anonymous." However, due to
financial difficulties the whole printing was, for a while, held up and
the book received no publicity, nor, of course, was it available in the
stores, even if one knew it existed. But somehow my good doctor heard of
this book and also he learned a little about the people responsible for
its publication. He sent to New York for a copy, and after reading it he
tucked it under his arm and called on me. That call marked the turning
point in my life.

Until now, I had never been told that I was an alcoholic. Few doctors
will tell a hopeless patient that there is no answer for him or for her.
But this day my doctor gave it to me straight and said, "People like

you are pretty well known to the medical profession. Every doctor gets
his quota of alcoholic patients. Some of us struggle with these people
because we know that they are really very sick, but we also know that
short of some miracle, we are not going to help them except temporarily,
and that they will inevitably get worse and worse until one of two
things happens. Either they die of acute alcoholism or they develop wet
brains and have to be put away permanently."

He further explained that alcohol was no respecter of sex or background,
but that most of the alcoholics he had encountered had better than
average minds and abilities. He said the alcoholic seemed to possess a
native acuteness and usually excelled in his field, regardless of
environmental or educational advantages.

"We watch the alcoholic performing in a position of responsibility and
we know that because he is drinking heavily and daily he has cut his
capacities by fifty percent, and still he seems able to do a
satisfactory job. And we wonder how much further this man could go if
his alcoholic problem could be removed and he could throw one hundred
percent of his abilities into action. But, of course," he continued,
"eventually the alcoholic loses all of his capacities as his disease
gets progressively worse, and this is a tragedy that is painful to
watch; the disintegration of a sound mind and body."

Then he told me there was a handful of people in Akron and New York who
had worked out a technique for arresting their alcoholism. He asked me
to read the book "Alcoholics Anonymous," and then he wanted me to talk
with a man who was experiencing success with his own arrestment. This
man could tell

me more. I stayed up all night reading that book. For me it was a
wonderful experience. It explained so much I had not understood about
myself and, best of all, it promised recovery if I would do a few simple
things and be willing to have the desire to drink removed. Here was
hope. Maybe I could find my way out of this agonizing existence. Perhaps
I could find freedom and peace and be able once again to call my soul my
own.

The next day I received a visit from Mr. T., a recovered alcoholic. I
don't know what sort of person I was expecting, but I was very agreeably
surprised to find Mr. T. a poised, intelligent, well groomed and
mannered gentleman. I was immediately impressed with his graciousness
and charm. He put me at ease with his first few words. Looking at him it
was hard to believe he had ever been as I was then.

However, as he unfolded his story for me, I could not help but believe
him. In describing his suffering, his fears, his many years of groping
for some answer to that which always seemed to remain unanswerable, he
could have been describing me, and nothing short of experience and
knowledge could have afforded him that much insight! He had been dry for
two and a half years and had been maintaining his contact with a group
of recovered alcoholics in Akron. Contact with this group was extremely
important to him. He told me that eventually he hoped such a group would
develop in the Chicago area, but that so far this had not been started.
He thought it would be helpful for me to visit the Akron group and meet
many like himself.

By this time, with the doctor's explanation, the revelations contained
in the book, and the hope-inspiring

interview with Mr. T., I was ready and willing to go into the interior
of the African jungles, if that was what it took, for me to find what
these people had.

So I went to Akron, and also to Cleveland, and I met more recovered
alcoholics. I saw in these people a quality of peace and serenity that I
knew I must have for myself. Not only were they at peace with
themselves, but they were getting a kick out of life such as one seldom
encounters, except in the very young. They seemed to have all the
ingredients for successful living. Philosophy, faith, a sense of humor
(they could laugh at themselves), clear-cut objectives,
appreciation---and most especially appreciation and sympathetic
understanding for their fellow man. Nothing in their lives took
precedence over their response to a call for help from some alcoholic in
need. They would travel miles and stay up all night with someone they
had never laid eyes on before and think nothing of it. Far from
expecting praise for their deeds, they claimed the performance a
privilege and insisted that they invariably received more than they
gave. Extraordinary people!

I didn't dare hope I might find for myself all that these people had
found, but if I could acquire some small part of their intriguing
quality of living---and sobriety---that would be enough.

Shortly after I returned to Chicago, my doctor, encouraged by the
results of my contact with A.A., sent us two more of his alcoholic
patients. By the latter part of September 1939, we had a nucleus of six
and held our first official group meeting.

I had a tough pull back to normal good health. It has been so many years
since I had not relied on some

artificial crutch, either alcohol or sedatives. Letting go of everything
at once was both painful and terrifying. I could never have accomplished
this alone. It took the help, understanding and wonderful companionship
that was given so freely to me by my "ex-alkie" friends. This and the
program of recovery embodied in the Twelve Steps. In learning to
practice these steps in my daily living I began to acquire faith and a
philosophy to live by. Whole new vistas were opened up for me, new
avenues of experience to be explored, and life began to take on color
and interest. In time, I found myself looking forward to each new day
with pleasurable anticipation.

A.A. is not a plan for recovery that can be finished and done with. It
is a way of life, and the challenge contained in its principles is great
enough to keep any human being striving for as long as he lives. We do
not, cannot, outgrow this plan. As arrested alcoholics, we must have a
program for living that allows for limitless expansion. Keeping one foot
in front of the other is essential for maintaining our arrestment.
Others may idle in a retrogressive groove without too much danger, but
retrogression can spell death for us. However, this isn't as rough as it
sounds, as we do become grateful for the necessity that makes us toe the
line, for we find that we are more than compensated for a consistent
effort by the countless dividends we receive.

A complete change takes place in our approach to life. Where we used to
run from responsibility, we find ourselves accepting it with gratitude
that we can successfully shoulder it. Instead of wanting to escape some
perplexing problem, we experience a thrill of challenge in the
opportunity it affords for another ap-

plication of A.A. techniques, and we find ourselves tackling it with
surprising vigor.

The last fifteen years of my life have been rich and meaningful. I have
had my share of problems, heartaches and disappointments, because that
is life, but also I have known a great deal of joy, and a peace that is
the handmaiden of an inner freedom. I have a wealth of friends and, with
my A.A. friends, an unusual quality of fellowship. For, to these people,
I am truly related. First, through mutual pain and despair, and later
through mutual objectives and new-found faith and hope. And, as the
years go by, working together, sharing our experiences with one another,
and also sharing a mutual trust, understanding and love---without
strings, without obligation---we acquire relationships that are unique
and priceless.

There is no more "aloneness," with that awful ache, so deep in the heart
of every alcoholic that nothing, before, could ever reach it. That ache
is gone and never need return again.

Now there is a sense of belonging, of being wanted and needed and loved.
In return for a bottle and a hangover, we have been given the Keys of
the Kingdom.


## Housewife

She hid her bottles in the clothes hampers and in the dresser drawers.
She realized what she was becoming. In A.A., she discovered she had lost
nothing and had found everything.

MY STORY HAPPENS to be a particular kind of woman's story; the story of
the woman who drinks at home. I had to be at home. I had two babies.
When alcohol took me over, my bar was my kitchen, my living room, my
bedroom, the back bathroom, and the two hampers.

At one time, the admission that I was and am an alcoholic meant shame,
defeat, and failure to me. But in the light of the new understanding
that I have found in A.A., I have been able to interpret that defeat,
and that failure, and that shame, as seeds of victory. Because it was
only through feeling defeat and feeling failure, the inability to cope
with my life and with alcohol, that I was able to surrender and accept
the fact that I had this disease, and that I had to learn to live again
without alcohol.

I was never a very heavy social drinker. But during a period of
particular stress and strain about thirteen years ago, I resorted to
alcohol in my home, alone, as a means of temporary release, as a means
of getting a little extra sleep.

I had problems. We all have them, and I thought a little brandy or a
little wine now and then could certainly hurt no one. I don't believe,
when I started, that I even had in mind the thought that I was drinking.
I had to sleep, I had to clear my mind and free it from worry, and I had
to relax. But from one or two drinks of an afternoon or evening, my
intake mounted, and mounted fast. It wasn't long before I was drinking
all day. I had to have that wine. The only incentive that I had, toward
the end, for getting dressed in the morning was to get out and get
supplies to help me get my day started. But the only thing that got
started was my drinking.

I should have realized that alcohol was getting hold of me when I
started to become secretive in my drinking. I began to have to have
supplies on hand for the people who "might come in." And of course a
half empty bottle wasn't worth keeping, so I finished it up and
naturally had to get more in right away for the people who "might come
in unexpectedly." But I was always the unexpected person who had to
finish the bottle. I couldn't go to one wine store and look the man
honestly in the face and buy a bottle, as I used to do when I had
parties and entertained and did normal drinking. I had to give him a
story and ask him the same question over and over again, "Well, now, how
many will that bottle serve?" I wanted him to be sure that I wasn't the
one who was going to drink the whole bottle.

I had to hide, as a great many people in A.A. have had to do. I did my
hiding in the hampers and in my dresser drawers. When we begin to do
things like that with alcohol, something's gone wrong. I needed it,

and I knew I was drinking too much, but I wasn't conscious of the fact
that I should stop. I kept on. My home at that time was a place to mill
around in. I wandered from room to room, thinking, drinking, drinking,
thinking. And the mops would get out, the vacuum would get out,
everything would get out, but nothing would get done. Toward five
o'clock, helter-skelter, I'd get everything put away and try to get
supper on the table, and after supper I'd finish the job up and knock
myself out.

I never knew which came first, the thinking or the drinking. If I could
only stop thinking, I wouldn't drink. If I could only stop drinking,
maybe I wouldn't think. But they were all mixed up together, and I was
all mixed up inside. And yet I had to have that drink. You know the
deteriorating effects, the disintegrating effects of chronic
wine-drinking. I cared nothing about my personal appearance. I didn't
care nothing about my personal appearance. I didn't care what I looked
like, I didn't care what I did. To me, taking a bath was just being in a
place with a bottle where I could drink in privacy. I had to have it
with me at night, in case I woke up and needed that drink.

How I ran my home, I don't know. I went on, realizing what I was
becoming, hating myself for it, bitter, blaming life, blaming everything
else but the fact that I should turn about and do something about my
drinking. Finally I didn't care, I was beyond caring. I just wanted to
live to a certain age, carry through with what I felt was my job with
the children, and after that---no matter. Half a mother was better than
no mother at all.

I needed that alcohol. I couldn't live without it. I couldn't do
anything without it. But there came a

point when I could no longer live with it. And that came after a
three-weeks' illness of my son. The doctor prescribed brandy for the boy
to help him through the night when he coughed, a teaspoon of brandy.
Well, of course that was all I needed---to switch from wine to brandy
for three weeks. I knew nothing about alcoholism or the D.T.'s, but when
I woke up on this last morning of my son's illness, I taped the keyhole
on my door because "everyone was out there." I paced back and forth in
the apartment with the cold sweats. I screamed on the telephone for my
mother to get up there; something was going to happen; I didn't know
what, but if she didn't get there quick, I'd split wide open. I called
my husband up and told him to come home.

After that I sat for a week, a body in a chair, a mind off in space. I
thought the two would never get together. I knew that alcohol and I had
to part. I couldn't live with it any more. And yet, how was I going to
live without it? I didn't know. I was bitter, living in hate. The very
person who stood with me through it all and has been my greatest help
was the person that I turned against, my husband. I also turned against
my family, my mother. The people who would have come to help me were
just the people I would have nothing to do with.

Nevertheless, I began to try to live without alcohol. But I only
succeeded in fighting it. And believe me, an alcoholic cannot fight
alcohol. I had all kinds of reasons for my drinking. I had problems. I
was a woman, tied to my home. What I needed was a change, mental
relaxation, getting out and doing something. I thought that was my
answer. I said to

my husband, "I'm going to try, every free moment that I have, to get
interested in something outside, get myself over this rut I'm in." I
thought I was going out of my mind. If I didn't have a drink, I had to
do something.

I became one of the most active women in the community, what with
P.T.A., other community organizations and drives. I'd go into an
organization, and it wasn't long before I was on the committee, then I
was chairman of the committee; and if I was in a group, I'd soon be
treasurer or secretary of the group. But I wasn't happy. I became a
Jekyll-and-Hyde person. As long as I worked, as long as I got out, I
didn't drink. But I had to get back to that first drink somehow. And
when I took that first drink, I was off on the usual merry-go-round. And
it was my home that suffered. My husband, my children saw the other side
of me. So that didn't work.

I figured I'd be all right if I could find something I liked to do. So
when the children were in school from nine to three, I started up a nice
little business and was fairly successful in it. But not happy. Because
I found that everything I turned to became a substitute for drink. And
when all of life is a substitute for drink, there's no happiness, no
peace. I still had to drink; I still needed that drink. Mere cessation
from drinking is not enough for an alcoholic while the need for that
drink goes on. I switched to beer. I had always hated beer, but now I
grew to love it, bottle after bottle of it, warm or cold. So that wasn't
my answer either.

I went to my doctor again. He knew what I was

doing, how I was trying. I said, "I can't find my middle road in life. I
can't find it. It's either all work, or I drink." He said, "Why don't
you try Alcoholics Anonymous?" I was willing to try anything. I was
licked. For the second time, I was licked. The first time was when I
knew I couldn't live with alcohol. But this second time, I found I
couldn't live normally without it, and I was licked worse than ever.

The fellowship I found in A.A. enabled me to face my problem honestly
and squarely. I couldn't do it among my relatives, I couldn't do it
among my friends. No one likes to admit that they're a drunk, that they
can't control this thing. But when we come into A.A., we can face our
problem honestly and openly. I went to closed meetings and open
meetings. And I took everything that A.A. had to give me. Easy does it,
first things first, one day at a time. It was at that point that I
reached surrender. I heard one very ill woman say that she didn't
believe in the surrender part of the A.A. program. My heavens! Surrender
to me has meant the ability to run my home, to face my responsibilities
as they should be faced, to take life as it comes to me day by day, and
work my problems out. That's what surrender has meant to me. I
surrendered once to the bottle, and I couldn't do these things. Since I
gave my will over to A.A., whatever A.A. has wanted of me I've tried to
do to the best of my ability. When I'm asked to go out on a call, I go.
I'm not going; A.A. is leading me there. A.A. gives us alcoholics
direction into a way of life without the need for alcohol. That life for
me is lived one day at a time, letting the problems of the future rest
with the future.

When the time comes to solve them, God will give me strength for that
day.

I had been brought up to believe in God, but I know that until I found
this A.A. program, I had never found or known faith in the reality of
God, the reality of His power that is now with me in everything I do.

## Earl

Psychiatrist and surgeon, he had lost his way until he realized that
God, not he, was the Great Healer.

I AM A PHYSICIAN, licensed to practice in a western state. I am also an
alcoholic. In two ways I may be a little different from other
alcoholics. First, we all hear at A.A. meetings about those who have
lost everything, those who have been in jail, those who have been in
prison, those who have lost their families, those who have lost their
income. I never lost any of it. I never was on skid row. I made more
money the last year of my drinking than I ever made before in my whole
life. My wife never hinted that she would leave me. Everything that I
touched from grammar school on was successful. I was president of my
grammar school student body. I was president of all my classes in high
school and in my last year I was president of that student body. I was
president of each class in the University, and president of that student
body. I was voted the man most likely to succeed. The same thing
occurred in medical school. I belong to more medical societies and honor
societies than men ten to twenty years my senior.

Mine was the skid row of success. The physical skid row in any city is
miserable. The skid row of success is just as miserable.

The second way in which, perhaps, I differ from some other alcoholics is
this; many alcoholics state that they didn't particularly like the taste
of alcohol, but that they liked the effect. I loved alcohol! I used to
like to get it on my fingers so I could lick them and get another taste.
I had a lot of fun drinking. I enjoyed it immensely. And then one
ill-defined day, one day that I can't recall, I stepped across the line
that alcoholics know so well, and from that day on drinking was
miserable. When a few drinks made me feel good before I went over that
line, those same drinks now made me wretched. In an attempt to get over
that feeling, there was a quick onslaught of a greater number of drinks,
and then all was lost. Alcohol failed to serve the purpose.

On the last day I was drinking I went up to see a friend who had had a
good deal of trouble with alcohol, and whose wife had left him a number
of times. He had come back, however, and he was on this program. In my
stupid way I went up to see him with the idea in the back of my mind
that I would investigate Alcoholics Anonymous from a medical standpoint.
Deep in my heart was the feeling that maybe I could get some help here.
This friend gave me a pamphlet, and I took it home and had my wife read
it to me. There were two sentences in it that struck me. One said,
"Don't feel that you are a martyr because you stopped drinking," and
this hit me between the eyes. The second one said, "Don't feel that you
stop drinking for anyone other than yourself," and this hit me between
the eyes. After my wife had read this to me, I said to her, as I had
said many times in desperation, "I have got to do something." She's a
good-natured soul and said, "I wouldn't worry about it; probably
something will happen." And then we went up the side of a hill where we
have a little barbeque area to make the fire for the barbecue, and on
the way up, I thought to myself---I'll go back down to the kitchen and
refill this drink. And just then something did happen.

The thought came to me--- This is the last one! I was well into the
second fifth by this time. And as that thought came to me, it was as
though someone had reached down and taken a heavy overcoat off my
shoulders, for that was the last one.

About two days later I was called by a friend of mine from Nevada
City---he's a brother of my wife's closest friend. He said, "Earl?" and
I said, "Yes." He said, "I'm an alcoholic, what do I do?" And I gave him
some idea of what you do, and so I made my first Twelfth Step call
before I ever came into the program. The satisfaction I got from giving
him a little of what I had read in those pamphlets far surpassed any
feeling that I had ever had before in helping patients.

So I decided that I would go to my first meeting. I was introduced as a
psychiatrist. (I belong to the American Psychiatric Society, but I don't
practice psychiatry as such. I am a surgeon.)

As someone in A.A. said to me once upon a time, there is nothing worse
than a confused psychiatrist.

I will never forget the first meeting that I attended. There were five
people present, including myself. At one end of the table sat our
community butcher. At the other side of the table sat one of the
carpenters in our community, and at the further end of the table sat the
man who ran the bakery, while on one side sat my friend who was a
mechanic. I recall, as I walked into that meeting, saying to myself,
"Here I am, a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons, a Fellow of
the International College of Surgeons, a diplomat of one of the great
specialty boards in these United States, a member of the American
Psychiatric Society, and I have to go to the butcher, the baker and the
carpenter to help make a man out of me!"

Something else happened to me. This was such a new thought that I got
all sorts of books on Higher Powers, and I put a Bible by my bedside,
and I put a Bible in my car. It is still there. And I put a Bible in my
locker at the hospital. And I put a Bible in my desk. And I put a Big
Book by my night stand, and I put a "Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions"
in my locker at the hospital, and I got books by Emmet Fox, and I got
books by God-knows-who, and I got to reading all these things. And the
first thing you know I was lifted right out of the A.A. group, and I
floated higher, and higher, and even higher, until I was way up on a
pink cloud which is known as Pink Seven, and I felt miserable again. So
I thought to myself, I might just as well be drunk as feel like this.

I went to Clark, the community butcher, and I said, "Clark, what is the
matter with me? I don't feel right. I have been on this program for
three months and I feel terrible." And he said, "Earl, why don't you
come on over and let me talk to you for a minute." So he got me a cup of
coffee, and a piece of cake, and sat me down and said, "Why, there's
nothing wrong with you. You've been sober for three months, been working
hard. You've been doing all right." But then he said, "Let me say
something to you. We have here in this community an organization which
helps people, and this organization is known as Alcoholics Anonymous.
Why don't you join it?" I said, "What do you think I've been doing?"
"Well," he said, "you've been sober, but you've been floating way up on
a cloud somewhere. Why don't you go home and get the Big Book and open
it at page seventy and see what it says?" So I did. I got the Big Book
and I read it, and this is what it said: "Rarely have we seen a person
fail who has thoroughly followed our path." The word "thoroughly" rang a
bell. And then it went on to say: "Half measures availed us nothing. We
stood at the turning point." And the last sentence was "We asked His
protection and care with complete abandon."

"Complete abandon"; "Half measures availed us nothing"; "Thoroughly
follow our path"; "Completely give oneself to this simple
program"---rang in my swelled head.

In 1935, as a physician, I went into psychoanalysis to get relief. I
spent five and a half years in psychoanalysis and proceeded to become a
drunk. I don't mean that in any sense as a derogatory statement about
psychotherapy; it's a very great tool, not too potent, but a great tool.
I would do it again.

I tried every gimmick that there was to get some peace of mind, but it
was not until I was brought to my alcoholic knees, when I was brought to
a group in my own community with the butcher, the baker, the carpenter
and the mechanic, who were able to give me the Twelve Steps, that I was
finally given some semblance of an answer to the last half of the First
Step. So, after taking the first half of the First Step, and very
gingerly admitting myself to Alcoholics Anonymous, something happened.
And then I thought to myself: "Imagine an alcoholic admitting anything!"
But I made my admission just the same.

The Third Step said: "Made a decision to turn our will and our lives
over to the care of God as we understood Him." Now they asked us to make
a decision! We've got to turn the whole business over to some joker we
can't even see! And this chokes the alcoholic. Here he is powerless,
unmanageable, in the grip of something bigger than he is, and he's got
to turn the whole business over to someone else! It fills the alcoholic
with rage. We are great people. We can handle anything. And so one gets
to thinking to oneself, "Who is this God? Who is this fellow we are
supposed to turn everything over to? What can He do for us that we can't
do for ourselves?" Well, I don't know who He is, but I've got my own
idea.

For myself, I have an absolute proof of the existence of God. I was
sitting in my office one time after I had operated on a woman. It was a
long four or five hour operation, a large surgical procedure, and she
was on her ninth or tenth post-operative day. She was doing fine, she
was up and around, and that day her husband phoned me and said, "Doctor,
thanks very much for curing my wife," and I thanked him for his
felicitations, and he hung up. And then I scratched my head, and said to
myself, "What a fantastic thing for a man to say, that I cured his wife.
Here I am down at my office behind my desk and there she is out at the
hospital. I am not even there, and if I was there the only thing I could
do would be to give her moral support, and yet he thanks me for curing
his wife." I thought to myself---what is curing that woman? Yes, I put
in those stitches. The Great Boss had given me diagnostic and surgical
talent, and He has loaned it to me to use for the rest of my life. It
doesn't belong to me. He has loaned it to me and I did my job, but that
ended nine days ago. What healed those tissues, those tissues that I
closed, what healed them? I didn't. This to me is the proof of the
existence of a Somethingness greater than I am. I couldn't practice
medicine without the Great Physician. All I do in a very simple way, is
to help Him cure my patients.

Shortly after I was starting to work on the program I realized that I
was not a good father; I wasn't a good husband, but, oh, I was a good
provider. I never robbed my family of anything. I gave them everything,
except the greatest thing in the world, and that is peace of mind. So I
went to my wife and asked her, wasn't there something that she and I
could do to somehow get together, and she turned on her heel and looked
me squarely in the eye, and said, "You don't care anything about my
problem," and I could have smacked her, but I said to myself, "Grab on
to your serenity!"

She left, and I sat down and crossed my hands, and looked up and said,
"For God's sake, help me." And then a silly, simple thought came to me.
I didn't know anything about being a father; I don't know how to come
home and work week-ends like other husbands; I don't know how to
entertain my family. But I remembered that every night after dinner my
wife would get up and do the dishes. Well, I could do the dishes. So I
went to her and said, "There's only one thing I want in my whole life,
and I don't want any commendation; I don't want any credit; I don't want
anything from you or Janey for the rest of your life except one thing;
and that is, the opportunity to do anything you want always, and I would
like to start off by doing the dishes." And now I am doing the darn
dishes every night!

Doctors have been notoriously unsuccessful in helping alcoholics. They
have contributed fantastic amounts of time and work to our problem, but
they aren't able, it seems, to arrest either your alcoholism or mine.

And the clergy have tried hard to help us, but we haven't been helped.
And the psychiatrist has had thousands of couches, and has put you and
me on them many, many times, but he hasn't helped us very much, though
he has tried hard; and we owe the clergy and the doctor and the
psychiatrist a deep debt of gratitude, but they haven't helped our
alcoholism, except in a rare few instances. But---Alcoholics Anonymous
has helped.

What is this power that A.A. possesses? This curative power? I don't
know what it is. I suppose the doctor might say, "This is psychosomatic
medicine." I suppose the psychiatrist might say, "This is benevolent
interpersonal relations." I suppose others would say, "This is group
psychotherapy."

To me it is God.

## Me

Barleycorn's wringer squeezed this author---but he escaped quite whole.

WHEN I TRY to reconstruct what my life was like "before," I see a coin
with two faces.

One, the side I turned to myself and the world, was respectable---even,
in some ways, distinguished. I was father, husband, taxpayer, home
owner. I was club-man, athlete, artist, musician, author, editor,
aircraft pilot and world traveler. I was listed in "Who's Who in
America" as an American who, by distinguished achievement, had arrived.
I was, so far as anybody could tell, quite a lad.

The other side of the coin was sinister, baffling. I was inwardly
unhappy most of the time. There would be times when the life of
respectability and achievement seemed insufferably dull---I had to break
out. This I would do by going completely "bohemian" for a night, getting
drunk and rolling home with the dawn. Next day remorse would be on me
like a tiger. I'd claw my way back to "respectability" and stay
there---until the inevitable next time.

The insidiousness of alcoholism is an appalling thing. In all the
twenty-five years of my drinking there were only a few occasions when I
took a morning drink. My binges were one-night stands only. Once or
twice, during my early drinking, I carried it over into the second day,
and only once, that I can remember, did it continue into the third. I
was never drunk on the job, never missed a day's work, was seldom
rendered totally ineffective by a hangover and kept my liquor expenses
well within my adequate budget. I continued to advance in my chosen
field. How could such a man possibly be called an alcoholic? Whatever
the root of my unhappiness might turn out to be, I thought, it could not
possibly be booze.

Of course I drank. Everybody did, in the set which I regarded as the
apex of civilization. My wife loved to drink, and we tied on many a
hooter in the name of marital bliss. My associates, and all the wits and
literary lights I so much admired, also drank. Evening cocktails were as
standard as morning coffee, and I suppose my average daily consumption
ran a little more or less than a pint. Even on my rare (at first) binge
nights it never ran much over a quart.

How easy it was, in the beginning, to forget that those binges ever
happened! After a day or two of groveling remorse I'd come up with an
explanation. "The nervous tension had piled up and just had to spill
over." Or, "My physical plant had got a little run down and the stuff
rushed right to my head." Or, "I got to talking and forgot how many I
was taking and it hit me." Always we'd emerge with a new formula for
avoiding future trouble. "You've got to space your drinks and take
plenty of water in between," or "coat the stomach with a little olive
oil," or "drink anything but those damn martinis." Weeks would go by
without further trouble, and I'd be assured I'd at last hit on the right
formula. The binge had been just "one of those things." After a month it
seemed unlikely that

it ever really happened. After three months it was forgotten. Intervals
between binges were, at first, eight months.

My growing inward unhappiness was a very real thing, however, and I knew
that something would have to be done about it. A friend had found help
in psychoanalysis. After a particularly ugly one-nighter, my wife
suggested I try it, and I agreed. Educated child of the scientific age
that I was, I had complete faith in the science of the mind. It would be
a sure cure and also an adventure. How exciting to learn the inward
mysteries that govern the behavior of people, how wonderful to know, at
last, all about myself! To cut a long story short, I spent seven years
and ten thousand dollars on my psychiatric adventure, and emerged in
worse condition than ever.

To be sure, I learned many fascinating things, and many things that were
to prove helpful later. I learned what a devastating effect it can have
on a child to coddle him and build him up, and then turn and beat him
savagely, as had happened to me. I came to understand the intricate
processes of projection, by which we cast into our adult world the
images of the horrors of our childhood. Under the skilled guidance of an
expert practitioner I wallowed in the world's individual and collective
mental agony.

Meanwhile, I was getting worse, both as regards my inward misery and my
drinking. My daily alcoholic consumption remained about the same through
all this, with perhaps a slight increase, and my binges remained
one-nighters. But they were occurring with alarming frequency. In seven
years the intervals between them decreased from eight months to ten
days!

And they were growing uglier. One night I barely made my downtown club;
if I'd had to go another fifty feet I'd have collapsed in the gutter. On
another occasion I arrived home covered with blood. I'd deliberately
smashed a window. With all this, it was becoming increasingly hard to
maintain my front of distinction and respectability to the world. My
personality was stretched almost to splitting in the effort;
schizophrenia stared me in the face, and one night I was in a suicidal
despair.

My outward professional life looked fine, on the surface. I was now head
of a publishing venture in which nearly a million dollars had been
invested. My opinions were quoted in Time and Newsweek with pictures,
and I addressed the public by radio and television. It was a fantastic
structure, built on a crumbling foundation. It was tottering and it had
to fall. It did.

After my last binge I came home and smashed my dining room furniture to
splinters, kicked out six windows and two balustrades. When I woke up
sober, my handiwork confronted me. It is impossible for me to reproduce
my despair. I can only list a few of its elements.

I'd had absolute faith in science, and only in science. "Knowledge is
power," I'd always been taught. Now I had to face up to the fact that
knowledge of this sort, applied to my individual case, was not power.
Science could take my mind apart expertly, but it couldn't seem to put
it together again. I crawled back to my analyst, not so much because I
had faith in him, but because I had nowhere else to turn.

After talking with him for a time I heard myself saying, "Doc, I think
I'm an alcoholic."

"Yes," he said, surprisingly, "you are."

"Then why in God's name haven't you told me so, during all these years?"

"Two reasons," he said. "First, I couldn't be sure. The line between a
heavy drinker and an alcoholic is not always clear. It wasn't until just
lately that, in your case, I could draw it. Second, you wouldn't have
believed me even if I had told you."

I had to admit to myself that he was right. Only through being beaten
down by my own misery would I ever have accepted the term "alcoholic" as
applied to myself. Now, however, I accepted it fully. I knew from my
general reading that alcoholism was irreversible and fatal. And I knew
that somewhere along the line I'd lost the power to stop drinking.
"Well, Doc," I said, "what are we going to do?"

"There's nothing I can do," he said, "and nothing medicine can do.
However, I've heard of an organization called Alcoholics Anonymous that
has had some success with people like you. They make no guarantees and
are not always successful. But if you want to, you're free to try them.
It might work."

Many times in the intervening years I have thanked God for that man, a
man who had the courage to admit failure, a man who had the humility to
confess that all the hard-won learning of his profession could not turn
up the answer. I looked up an A.A. meeting and went there---alone.

Here I found an ingredient that had been lacking in any other effort I
had made to save myself. Here was---power! Here was power to live to the
end of any given day, power to have the courage to face the next day,
power to have friends, power to help people, power to be sane, power to
stay sober. That was November, 1947. It is now past November, 1954, and
I haven't had a drink during those seven years. More over, I am deeply
convinced that so long as I continue to strive, in my bumbling way,
toward the principles I first encountered in the earlier chapters of
this book, this remarkable power will continue to flow through me. What
is this power? With my A.A. friends, all I can say is that it's a power
greater than myself. If pressed further, all I can do is follow the
psalmist who said it long, long before me: "Be still, and know that I am
God."

My story has a happy ending, but not of the conventional kind. I had a
lot more hell to go through. But what a difference there is between
going through hell without a power greater than one's self, and with it!
As might have been predicted, my teetering tower of worldly success
collapsed. My alcoholic associates fired me, took control, and ran the
enterprise into bankruptcy. My alcoholic wife took up someone else,
divorced me, and took with her all my remaining property. The most
terrible blow of my life befell me after I'd found sobriety through A.A.
Perhaps the single flicker of decency that shone through the fog of my
drinking days was a clumsy affection for my two children, a boy and a
girl. One night my son, when he was only sixteen, was suddenly and
tragically killed. The Higher Power was on deck to see me through,
sober. I think He's on hand to see my son through, too. I think He's on
hand to see all of us through whatever may come to us.

There have been some wonderful things, too. My new wife and I don't own
any property to speak of, and the flashy successes of another day are no
longer mine. But we have a baby who, if you'll pardon a little
post-alcoholic sentimentality, is right out of Heaven. My work is on a
much deeper and more significant level than it ever was before, and I am
today a fairly creative, relatively sane human being. And should I have
more bad times, I know that I'll never again have to go through them
alone.


## Bondage

Young when she joined, this A.A. believes her serious drinking was the
result of even deeper defects. She here tells how she was set free.

THE MENTAL TWISTS that led up to my drinking began many years before I
ever took a drink for I am one of those whose history proves
conclusively that my drinking was "a symptom of a deeper trouble."

Through my efforts to get down to "causes and conditions," I stand
convinced that my emotional illness has been present from my earliest
recollection. I never did react normally to any emotional situation.

The medical profession would probably tell me I was conditioned for
alcoholism by the things that happened to me in my childhood. And I am
sure they would be right as far as they go, but A.A. has taught me I am
the result of the way I reacted to what happened to me as a child. What
is much more important to me, A.A. has taught me that through this
simple program I may experience a change in this reaction pattern that
will indeed allow me to "match calamity with serenity."

I am an only child, and when I was seven years old my parents separated
very abruptly. With no explanation at all, I was taken from my home in
Florida to my grandparents' home in the middle west. My mother went to a
nearby city to go to work, and my father, being an alcoholic, simply
went. My grandparents were strangers to me and I remember being lonely,
and terrified and hurt.

In time I concluded that the reason I was hurt was because I loved my
parents, and I concluded too that if I never allowed myself to love
anybody or anything I could never be hurt again. It became second nature
for me to remove myself from anything or anybody I found myself growing
fond of.

I grew up believing that one had to be totally self-sufficient, for one
never dared to depend on another human being. I thought that life was a
pretty simple thing; you simply made a plan for your life, based upon
what you wanted, and then you needed only the courage to go after it. I
thought I knew exactly what I wanted out of life and I thought I knew
exactly how to get it.

In my late teens I became aware of emotions I'd not counted on;
restlessness, anxiety, fear and insecurity. The only kind of security I
knew anything about at that time was material security and I decided
that all these intruders would vanish immediately if I only had a lot of
money. The solution seemed very simple. With cold calculation I set
about to marry a fortune, and I did. The only thing this changed,
however, was my surroundings, and it was soon apparent that I could have
the same uncomfortable emotions with an unlimited checking account that
I could on a working girl's salary. It was impossible for me to say at
this point, "Maybe there is something wrong with my philosophy," and I
certainly couldn't say, "Maybe there is something wrong with me." It was
not difficult to convince myself that my unhappiness was the fault of
the man I had married, and I divorced him at the end of a year.

I was married and divorced again before I was twenty-three years old,
this time to a prominent band leader---a man that many women wanted. I
thought this would give me ego-strength, make me feel wanted and secure,
and alleviate my fears, but again nothing changed inside me.

The only importance in all of this lies in the fact that at twenty-three
I was just as sick as I was at thirty-three, when I came into A.A., but
at that time I apparently had no place to go because I had no drinking
problem. Had I been able to explain to a psychiatrist the feelings of
futility, loneliness and lack of purpose, that had come with my deep
sense of personal failure at this second divorce, I seriously doubt that
the good doctor could have convinced me that my basic problem was a
spiritual hunger, but A.A. has shown me this was the truth. And if I had
been able to turn to the church at that time I'm sure they could not
have convinced me my sickness was within myself, nor could they have
shown me the need for self-analysis that A.A. has shown me is vital if I
am to survive. So I had no place to go. Or so it seemed to me.

I looked around me at people who seemed happy and tried to analyze their
happiness, and it seemed to me that without exception these people had
something or somebody they loved very much. I didn't have the courage to
love; I was not even sure I had the capacity. Fear of rejection and its
ensuing pain were not to be risked, and I turned away from myself once
more for the answer, this time to the drinks I had always refused
before, and in alcohol I found a false courage.

I wasn't afraid of anything or anybody after I learned about drinking,
for it seemed right from the beginning that with liquor I could always
retire to my little private world where nobody could get at me to hurt
me. It seems only fitting that when I did finally fall in love it was
with an alcoholic, and for the next ten years I progressed as rapidly as
is humanly possible into what I believed to be hopeless alcoholism.

During this time, our country was engaged in a second World War and my
husband was one of the first to go overseas. My reaction to this was
identical in many respects to my reaction to my parents leaving me when
I was seven. Apparently I'd grown physically at the customary rate of
speed, and I had acquired an average amount of intellectual training in
the intervening years, but there had been no emotional maturity at all.
I realize now that this phase of my development had been arrested by my
obsession with self, and my egocentricity had reached such proportions
that adjustment to anything outside my personal control was impossible
for me. I was immersed in self-pity and resentment, and the only people
who would support this attitude or who I felt understood me at all were
the people I met in bars and the ones who drank as I did. It became more
and more necessary to escape from myself, for my remorse and shame and
humiliation when I was sober were almost unbearable. The only way
existence was possible was through rationalizing every sober moment and
drinking myself into complete oblivion as often as I could.

My husband eventually returned, but it was not

long until we realized we could not continue our marriage. By this time
I was such a past master at kidding myself that I had convinced myself I
had sat out a war and waited for this man to come home and, as my
resentment and self-pity grew, so did my alcoholic problem.

The last three years of my drinking, I drank on my job. The amount of
will power exercised to control my drinking during working hours,
diverted into a constructive channel, would have made me President, and
the thing that made the will power possible was the knowledge that as
soon as my day was finished I could drink myself into oblivion. Inside,
though, I was scared to death, for I new that the time was coming (and
it couldn't be too remote) when I would be unable to hold that job.
Maybe I wouldn't be able to hold any job, or maybe (and this was my
greatest fear) I wouldn't care whether I had a job or not. I knew it
didn't make any difference where I started, the inevitable end would be
skid row. The only reality I was able to face had been forced upon me by
its very repetition---I had to drink; and I didn't know there was
anything in the world that could be done about it.

About this time, I met a man who had three motherless children and it
seemed that might be a solution to my problem. I had never had a child
and this had been a satisfactory excuse many times for my drinking. It
seemed logical to me that if I married this man and took the
responsibility for these children that they would keep me sober. So I
married again. This caused the rather cryptic comment from one of my
A.A. friends, when I told my story after coming into the program, "that
I had always been a cinch for the program, for I had always been
interested in mankind, but that I was just taking them one man at a
time."

The children kept me sober for darn near three weeks, and then I went on
(please God) my last drunk. I've heard it said many times in A.A.,
"There is just one good drunk in every alcoholic's life, and that's the
one that brings us into A.A.," and I believe it. I was drunk for sixty
days around the clock and it was my intention, literally, to drink
myself to death. I went to jail for the second time during this period
for being drunk in an automobile. I was the only person I'd ever known
personally who had ever been in jail, and I guess it is most significant
that the second time was less humiliating than the first had been.

Finally, in desperation, my family appealed to a doctor for advice and
he suggested A.A. The people who came knew immediately I was in no
condition to absorb anything of the program, and I was put in a
sanitarium to be defogged so that I could make a sober decision about
this for myself. It was here that I realized for the first time that as
a practicing alcoholic I had no rights. Society can do anything it
chooses to do with me when I am drunk and I can't lift a finger to stop
it, for I forfeit my rights through the simple expedient of becoming a
menace to myself and to the people around me. With deep shame came the
knowledge too that I had lived with no sense of social obligation nor
had I known the meaning of moral responsibility to my fellow man.

I attended my first A.A. meeting on July 25th, 1947, and it is with deep
gratitude that I'm able to say I've not had a drink since that time, and
that I take no sedation or narcotics, for this program is to me one of
complete sobriety and I no longer need to escape reality. One of the
truly great things A.A. has taught me is that reality too has two sides;
I had only known the grim side before the program, but now I had a
chance to learn about the pleasant side as well.

The A.A. members who sponsored me told me in the beginning that I would
not only find a way to live without having a drink, but that I would
find a way to live without wantingto drink, if I would do these simple
things. They said if you want to know how this program works, take the
first word of your question---the H is for honesty, the O is for
open-mindedness and the W is for willingness; these our Book calls the
essentials of recovery. They suggested that I study the A.A. book and
try to take the Twelve Steps according to the explanation in the Book,
for it was their opinion that the application of these principles in our
daily lives will get us sober and keep us sober. I believe this, and I
believe too that it is equally impossible to practice these principles
to the best of our ability, a day at a time, and still drink, for I
don't think the two things are compatible.

I had no problem admitting I was powerless over alcohol, and I certainly
agreed that my life had become unmanageable. I had only to reflect on
the contrast between the plans I made so many years ago for my life with
what really happened to know I couldn't manage my life drunk or sober.
A.A. taught me that willingness to believe was enough for a beginning.
It's been true in my case, nor could I quarrel with "restore us to
sanity," for my actions drunk or sober, before A.A., were not those of a
sane person. My desire to be honest with myself made it necessary

for me to realize that my thinking was irrational. It had to be or I
could not have justified my erratic behavior as I did. I've been
benefited from a dictionary definition I found that reads:
"rationalization is giving a socially acceptable reason for socially
unacceptable behavior, and socially unacceptable behavior is a form of
insanity."

A.A. has given me serenity of purpose, the opportunity to be of service
to God and to the people about me, and I am serene in the infallibility
of these principles that provide the fulfillment of my purpose.

A.A. has taught me that I will have peace of mind in exact proportion to
the peace of mind I bring into the lives of the other people, and it has
taught me the true meaning of the admonition "happy are ye who know
these things and do them." For the only problems I have now are those I
create when I break out in a rash of self-will.

I've had many spiritual experiences since I've been in the program, many
that I didn't recognize right away, for I'm slow to learn and they take
many guises. But one was so outstanding that I like to pass it on
whenever I can in the hope that it will help someone else as it has me.
As I said earlier, self-pity and resentment were my constant companions
and my inventory began to look like a thirty-three year diary, for I
seemed to have a resentment against everybody I had ever known. All but
one "responded to the treatment" suggested in the Steps immediately, but
this one posed a problem.

It was against my mother and it was twenty-five years old. I had fed it,
fanned it and nurtured it as one might a delicate child, and it had
become as much

a part of me as my breathing. It had provided me with excuses for my
lack of education, my marital failures, personal failures, inadequacy,
and of course, my alcoholism and, though I really thought I had been
willing to part with it, now I knew I was reluctant to let it go.

One morning, however, I realized I had to get rid of it, for my reprieve
was running out, and if I didn't get rid of it I was going to get
drunk---and I didn't want to get drunk any more. In my prayers that
morning I asked God to point out to me some way to be free of this
resentment. During the day a friend of mine brought me some magazines to
take to a hospital group I was interested in, and I looked through them
and a "banner" across the front of one featured an article by a
prominent clergyman in which I caught the word "resentment."

He said, in effect: "If you have a resentment you want to be free of, if
you will pray for the person or the thing that you resent, you will be
free. If you will ask in prayer for everything you want for yourself to
be given to them, you will be free. Ask for their health, their
prosperity, their happiness, and you will be free. Even when you don't
really want it for them, and your prayers are only words and you don't
mean it, go ahead and do it anyway. Do it every day for two weeks and
you will find you have come to mean it and to want it for them, and you
will realize that where you used to feel bitterness and resentment and
hatred, you now feel compassionate understanding and love."

It worked for me then, and it has worked for me many times since, and it
will work for me every time I am willing to work it. Sometimes I have to
ask first for the willingness, but it too always comes. And because it
works for me, it will work for all of us. As another great man says,
"The only real freedom a human being can ever know is doing what you
ought to do because you want to do it."

This great experience that released me from the bondage of hatred and
replaced it with love is really just another affirmation of the truth I
know: I get everything I need in Alcoholics Anonymous---everything I
need I get---and when I get what I need I invariably find that it was
just what I wanted all the time.


## Brewmeister

An originator of Cleveland's Group No. 3, this one fought Prohibition in
vain.

STRANGELY ENOUGH, I became acquainted with the "hilarious life" just at
the time in my own life when I was beginning really to settle down to a
common-sense, sane domesticity. My wife became pregnant and the doctor
recommended the use of port or ale . . . so . . . I bought a six gallon
crock and a few bottles, listened to advice from amateur brewmeisters,
and was off on my beer manufacturing career on a small scale (for the
time being). Somehow or other, I must have misunderstood the doctor's
instructions, for I not only made beer for my wife, I also drank it for
her.

As time went on, I found that it was customary to open a few bottles
whenever visitors dropped in. That being the case, it didn't take me
long to figure out that my meager manufacturing facilities were entirely
inadequate to the manufacture of beer for social and domestic
consumption. From that point on, I secured crocks of ten gallon capacity
and really took quite an active interest in the manufacture of home
brew.

We were having card parties with limburger and beer quite regularly.
Eventually, of course, what with all the hilarity that could be provoked
with a few gallons of beer, there seemed to be no need of bridge or

poker playing for entertainment. The parties waxed more liquid and
hilarious as time went on, and eventually I discovered that a little
shot of liquor now and then between beers had the tendency to put me in
a whacky mood much quicker than having to down several quarts of beer to
obtain the same effect. The inevitable result of this discovery was that
I soon learned that beer made a very good chaser for whiskey. That
discovery so intrigued me, that I stayed on that diet almost entirely
for the balance of my extensive drinking life. The last day of my
drinking career, I drank twenty-two of them between ten and twelve a.m.
and I shall never know how many more followed them until I was poured
into bed that night.

I got along fairly well with my party drinking for quite some time, but
eventually I began to visit beer joints in between parties. A night or
so a week in a joint, and a party or so a week at home or with friends,
along with a little lone drinking, soon had me preparing for the
existence of a top flight drunkard.

Three years after I started on my drinking career, I lost my first job.
At the time, I was living out of town, so I moved back to the home town
and made a connection in a responsible position with one of the larger
companies in the finance business. Up to this point I had spent six
years in the business and had enjoyed the reputation of being very
successful.

My new duties were extremely confining and my liquor consumption began
to increase. Upon leaving the office in the evening, my first stop would
be a saloon about a block away. However, as there happened to be several
saloons within that distance, I didn't find it necessary to patronize
the same place

each evening. It doesn't pay to be seen in the same place at the same
hour every day.

The general procedure was to take four or five shots in the first place
I stopped at. This would get me feeling fit, and then I would start for
home and fireside, thirteen miles away. On the way home numerous places
must be passed. If I were alone I would stop at four or five of them,
but only one or two in the event I had my mistrusting wife with me.

Eventually I would arrive home for a late supper, for which, of course,
I had absolutely no relish. I would make a feeble attempt at eating
supper, but never met with any howling success. I never enjoyed any
meal, but I ate my lunch at noon for two reasons; first, to help get me
out of the fog of the night before, and second, to furnish some measure
of nourishment. Eventually, the noon meal was also dispensed with.

I cannot remember just when I became the victim of insomnia, but I do
know that the last year and a half I never went to bed sober a single
night. I couldn't sleep. I had a mortal fear of going to bed and tossing
all night. Evenings at home were an ordeal. As a result, I would fall
off in a drunken stupor every night.

How I was able to discharge my duties at the office during those
horrible mornings, I will never be able to explain. Handling customers,
dealers, insurance people, dictation, telephoning, directing new
employees, answering to superiors, and all the rest of it. However, it
finally caught up with me, and when it did, I was a mental, physical and
nervous wreck.

I arrived at the stage where I couldn't quite make it to the office some
mornings. Then I would send an

excuse of illness. But the firm became violently ill with my drunkenness
and their course of treatment was to remove their ulcer in the form of
me from their payroll, amid much fanfare and very personal and slighting
remarks and insinuations.

During this time, I had been threatened, beaten, kissed, praised and
damned alternately by relatives, family, friends and strangers, but of
course it all went for naught. How many times I swore off in the morning
and got drunk before sunset I don't know. I was on the toboggan and
really making time.

After being fired, I lined up with a new finance company that was just
starting in business, and took the position of business promotion man,
contacting automobile dealers. WOW . . . was that something??? While
working in an office, there was some semblance of restraint, but, oh
boy, when I got on the outside with this new company without
supervision, did I go to town???

I really worked for several weeks, and having had a fairly wide
acceptance with the dealer trade, it was not difficult for me to line
enough of them up to give me a very substantial volume of business with
a minimum of effort.

Now I was getting drunk all the time. It wasn't necessary to report in
to the office in person every day, and when I did go in, it was just to
make an appearance and bounce right out again.

Finally this company also became involved and I was once more looking
for a job. Then I learned something else. I learned that person just
can't find a job hanging in a dive or barroom all day and all night, as
jobs don't seem to turn up in those places. I became convinced of that
because I spent most if my time

there and nary a job turned up. By this time, my chances of getting
lined up in my chosen business were shot. Everyone had my number and
wouldn't hire me at any price.

I have omitted details of transgressions that I made when drunk for
several reasons. One is that I don't remember too many of them, as I was
one of those drunks who could be on his feet and attend a meeting or a
party, engage in a conversation with people and do things that any
nearly normal person would do, and the next day not remember a thing
about where I was, what I did, whom I saw, or how I got home. (That
condition was a distinct handicap to me in trying to vindicate myself
with the not so patient wife).

Things eventually came to the point where I had no friends. I didn't
care to go visiting unless the parties we might visit had plenty of
liquor on hand and I could get drunk. Indeed, I was always well on my
way before I would undertake to go visiting at all.

After holding good positions, making better than an average income for
over ten years, I was in debt, had no clothes to speak of, no money, no
friends, and no one any longer tolerating me but my wife. My son had
absolutely no use for me. Even some of the saloon-keepers, where I had
spent so much time and money, requested that I stay away from their
places. Finally, an old business acquaintance of mine, whom I hadn't
seen for several years offered me a job. I was on that job a month and
drunk most of the time.

Just at this time my wife heard of a doctor in another city who had been
very successful with drunks. She offered me the alternative of going to
see him or her leaving me for good and all. Well . . . I had a job,

and I really wanted desperately to stop drinking, but I couldn't, so I
readily agreed to visit the doctor she recommended.

That was the turning point of my life. My wife accompanied me on my
visit and the doctor really told me some things that in my state of
jitters nearly knocked me out of the chair. He talked about himself, but
I was sure it was me. He mentioned lies and deceptions in the course of
his story in the presence of the one person in the world I wouldn't want
to know such things. How did he know all this? I had never seen him
before, and at the time hoped I would never see him again. However, he
explained to me that he had been just such a rummy as I, only for a much
longer period of time.

He advised me to enter the particular hospital with which he was
connected and I readily agreed. In all honesty though, I was skeptical,
but I wanted so definitely to quit drinking that I would have welcomed
any sort of physical torture or pain to accomplish the result.

I made arrangements to enter the hospital three days later and promptly
went out and got stiff for three days. It was with grim foreboding and
advanced jitters that I checked in at the hospital. Of course, I had no
hint or intimation as to what the treatment was to consist of.

After being in the hospital for several days, a plan of living was
outlined to me. A very simple plan that I still find much joy and
happiness in following. It is impossible to put on paper all the
benefits I have derived . . . physical, mental, domestic, spiritual, and
monetary. This is no idle talk. It is the truth.

From a physical standpoint, I gained sixteen pounds in the first two
months I was off liquor. I eat three good meals a day now, and really
enjoy them. I sleep like a baby, and never give a thought to such a
thing as insomnia. I feel as I did when I was fifteen years younger.

Mentally . . . I know where I was last night, the night before, and the
nights before that. Also, I have no fear of anything. I have self
confidence and assurance that cannot be confused with the cockiness I
once possessed. I can think clearly and am helped much in my thinking
and judgment by my spiritual development which grows daily.

From a domestic standpoint, we really have a home now. I am anxious to
get home after dark. My wife is ever glad to see me come in. My
youngster had adopted me. Our home is always full of friends and
visitors (No home brew as an inducement).

Spiritually . . . I have found a Friend who never lets me down and is
ever eager to help. I can actually take my problems to Him and He gives
me comfort, peace, and happiness.

From a monetary standpoint . . . in the last few years, I have reduced
my reckless debts to almost nothing, and have had money to get along on
comfortably. I still have my job, and just prior to the writing of this
narrative, I received an advancement.

For all of these blessings, I thank Him.

## European

Beer and wine were not the answer.

I WAS born in Europe, in Alsace to be exact, shortly after it had become
German and practically grew up with "good Rhine wine" of song and story.
My parents had some vague ideas of making a priest out of me and for
some years I attended the Franciscan school at Basle, Switzerland, just
across the border, about six miles from my home. But, although I was a
good Catholic, the monastic life had little appeal for me.

Very early I became apprenticed to harness-making and acquired
considerable knowledge of upholstering. My daily consumption of wine was
about a quart, but that was common where I lived. Everybody drank wine.
And it is true that there was no great amount o f drunkenness. But I can
remember, in my teens, that there were a few characters who caused the
village heads to nod pityingly and sometimes in anger as they paused to
say, "That sot, Henri" and "Ce pauvre Jules," who drank too much. They
were undoubtedly the alcoholics of our village.

Military service was compulsory and I did my stretch with the class of
my age, goose-stepping in German barracks and taking part in the Boxer
Rebellion in China, my first time at any great distance from home. In
foreign parts many a soldier who has been

abstemious at home learns to use new and potent drinks. So I indulged
with my comrades in everything the Far East had to offer. I cannot say,
however, that I acquired any craving for hard liquor as a result. When I
got back to Germany I settled down to finish my apprenticeship, drinking
the wine of the country as usual.

Many friends of my family had emigrated to America, so at twenty-four I
decided that the United States offered me the opportunity I was never
likely to find in my native land. I came directly to a growing
industrial city in the middle west, where I have lived practically ever
since. I was warmly welcomed by friends of my youth who had preceded me.
For weeks after my arrival I was feted and entertained in the already
large colony of Alsatians in the city, among the Germans in their
saloons and clubs. I early decided that the wine of America was very
inferior stuff and took up beer instead.

Fond of singing, I joined a German singing society which had good club
headquarters. There I sat in the evenings, enjoying with my friends our
memories of the "old country," singing the old songs we all knew,
playing simple card games for drinks and consuming great quantities of
beer.

At that time I could go into any saloon, have one or two beers, walk out
and forget about it. I had no desire whatever to sit down at a table and
stay a whole morning or afternoon drinking. Certainly at that time I was
one of those who "can take it or leave it alone." There had never been
any drunkards in my family. I came of good stock, of men and women who
drank wine all their lives as a beverage, and while

they occasionally got drunk at special celebrations, they were up and
about their business the next day.

Prohibition came. Having regard for the law of the land, I resigned
myself to the will of the national legislators and quit drinking
altogether, not because I had found it harmful, but because I couldn't
get what I was accustomed to drink. You can all remember that in the
first few months after the change, a great many men, who had formerly
been used to a few beers every day or an occasional drink of whiskey,
simply quit all alcoholic drinks. For the great majority of us, however,
that condition didn't last. We saw very early that Prohibition wasn't
going to work. It wasn't very long before home-brewing was an
institution and men began to search ferverishly for old recipe books on
wine-making.

But I hardly tasted anything for two years and started in business for
myself, founding a mattress factory which is today an important
industrial enterprise in our city. I was doing very well with that and
general upholstering work, and there was every indication that I would
be financially independent by the time I reached middle age. By this
time I was married and was paying for a home. Like most immigrants I
Wanted to be somebody and have something and I was very happy and
contented as I felt success crown my efforts. I missed the old social
times, of course, but had no definite craving even for beer.

Successful home-brewers among my friends began to invite me to their
homes. I decided that if these fellows could make it I would try it
myself, and so I did. It wasn't very long until I had developed a pretty

good brew with uniformity and plenty of authority. I knew the stuff I
was making was a lot stronger than I had been used to, but never
suspected that steady drinking of it might develop a taste for something
even stronger still.

It wasn't long before the bootlegger was an established institution in
this, as in other towns. I was doing well in business, and in going
around town I was frequently invited to have a drink in a speakeasy. I
condoned my domestic brewing along with the bootleggers and their
business. More and more I formed the habit of doing some of my business
in the speakeasy, and after a time I did not need that as an excuse. The
"speaks" usually sold whiskey. Beer was too bulky and it couldn't be
kept in a jug under the counter ready to be dumped when John Law came
around. I was now forming an entirely new drinking technique. Before
long I had a definite taste for hard liquor, knew nausea and headaches I
had never known before, but as in the old days, I suffered them out.
Gradually, however, I'd suffer so much that I simply had to have the
morning-after drink.

I became a periodic drinker. I was eased out of the business I had
founded and was reduced to doing general upholstery in a small shop at
the back of my house. My wife upbraided me often and plenty when she saw
that my "periodics" were gradually losing me what business I could get.
I began to bring bottles in. I had them hidden away in the house and all
over my shop in careful concealment. I had all the usual experiences of
the alcoholic, for I was certainly one by this time. Sometimes, after
sobering up after a bout of several weeks, I would righteously resolve
to quit.

With a great deal of determination, I would throw out full pints---pour
them out and smash the bottles---firmly resolved never to take another
drink of the stuff. I was going to straighten up.

In four or five days I would be hunting all over the place, at home and
in my workshop, for the bottles I had destroyed, cursing myself for
being a fool. My "periodics" became more frequent until I reached the
point where I wanted to devote all my time to drinking, working as
little as possible, and then only when the necessity of my family
demanded it. As soon as I had satisfied that, what I earned as an
upholsterer went for liquor. I would promise to have jobs done and never
do them. My customers lost confidence in me to the point where I
retained what business I had only because I was a well-trained and
reputedly fine craftsman. "Best in the business, when he's sober," my
customers would say, and I still had a following who would give me work
though they deplored my habits, because they knew the job would be well
done when they eventually got it.

I had always been a good Catholic, possibly not so devoted as I should
have been, but fairly regular in my attendance at services. I had never
doubted the existence of the Supreme Being, but now I began to absent
myself from my church where I had formerly been a member of the choir.
Unfortunately, I had no desire to consult my priest about my drinking.
In fact I was scared to talk to him about it, for I feared the kind of
talk he would give me. Unlike many other Catholics who frequently take
pledges for definite periods---a year, two years or for good, I never
had any desire to "take a pledge" before the priest. And yet,

realizing at last that liquor really had me, I wanted to quit. My wife
wrote away for advertised cures for the liquor habit and gave them to me
in coffee. I even got them myself and tried them. None of the various
cures of this kind were any good.

Then occured the event that saved me. An alcoholic who was a doctor came
to see me. He didn't talk like a preacher at all. In fact his language
was perfectly suited to my understanding. He had no desire to know
anything, except whether I was definite about my desire to quit
drinking. I told him with all the sincerity at my command that I did.
Even then he went into no great detail about how he and a crowd of
alcoholics, with whom he associated, had mastered their difficulty.
Instead he told me that some of them wanted to talk to me and would be
over to see me.

This doctor had imparted his knowledge to just a few other men at that
time---not more than four or five---they now number more than seventy
persons.\* And, because as I have discovered since, it is part of the
"treatment" that these men be sent to see and talk with alcoholics who
want to quit, he kept them busy. He had already imbued them with his own
spirit until they were ready and willing at all times to go where sent,
and as a doctor he well knew that this mission and duty would strengthen
them as it later helped me. The visits from these men impressed me at
once. Where preaching and prayers had touched me very little, I
immediately desired further knowledge of these men.

I could see they were sober. The third man who came to see me had been
one of the greatest business-

\* Written in 1939.

getters his company had ever employed. From the top of the heap in a few
years he had skidded to becoming a shuffling customer, still entering
the better barrooms but welcomed by neither mine host nor his patrons.
His own business was practically gone, he told me, when he discovered
the answer.

"You've been trying man's ways and they always fail," he told me. "You
can't win unless you try God's way."

I had never heard of the remedy expressed in just this language. In a
few sentences he made God seem personal to me, explained Him as a being
who was interested in me, the alcoholic, and that all I needed to do was
to be willing to follow His way; that as long as I followed it I would
be able to overcome my desire for liquor.

Well, there I was, willing to try it, but I didn't know how, except in a
vague way. I knew somehow that it meant more than just going to church
and living a moral life. If that was all, then I was a little doubtful
that it was the answer I was looking for.

He went on talking and told me that he had found the plan has a basis of
love, and the practice of Christ's injunction, "Love thy neighbor as
thyself." Taking that as a foundation, he reasoned that if a man
followed that rule he could not be selfish. I could see that. And he
further said that God could not accept me as a sincere follower of His
Divine Law unless I was ready to be thoroughly honest about it.

That was perfectly logical. My church taught that. I had always known
that, in theory. We talked, too, about personal morals. Every man has
his problem of this kind, but we didn't discuss it very much. My visi-

tor well knew, that as I tried to follow God I would get to studying
these things out for myself.

That day I gave my will to God and asked to be directed. But I have
never thought of that as something to do and then forget about. I very
early came to see that there had to be a continual renewal of that
simple deal with God; that I had perpetually to keep the bargain. So I
began to pray; to place my problems in God's hands.

For a long time I kept on trying, in a pretty dumb way at first, I know,
but very earnestly. I didn't want to be a fake. And I began putting in
practice what I was learning every day. It wasn't very long until my
doctor friend sent me to tell another alcoholic what my experience had
been. This duty together with my weekly meetings with my fellow
alcoholics, and my daily renewal of the contract I originally made with
God, have kept me sober when nothing else ever did.

I have been sober for many years now. The first few months were hard.
Many things happened; business trials, little worries, and feelings of
general despondency came near driving me to the bottle, but I made
progress. As I go along I seem to get strength daily to be able to
resist more easily. And when I get upset, cross-grained and out of tune
with my fellow man I know that I am out of tune with God. Searching
where I have been at fault, it is not hard to discover and get right
again, for I have proven to myself and to many others who know me that
God can keep a man sober if he will let Him.

## Farm

She tells how A.A. works when the going is rough. A pioneer woman member
of A.A.'s first Group.

I COME FROM a very poor family in material things, with a fine Christian
mother, but with no religious background. I was the oldest in a family
of seven, and my father was an alcoholic. I was deprived of many of the
things that we feel are important in life, such as education
particularly, because of my father's drinking. Mine was far from a happy
childhood. I had none of those things that children should have to make
them happy.

We moved in from the country at the age when girls want all sorts of
nice things. I remember starting to city school, coming from a country
school, and wanting so very, very much to be like the other girls and
trying flour on my face for powder because I wasn't able to have any
real powder. I remember feeling that they were all making fun of me. I
feared that I wasn't dressed like the rest. I know that one of the
outfits I had was a skirt and a very funny looking blouse that my mother
had picked up at a rummage sale. I look back and remember these things
because they made me very unhappy, and added to my feeling of
inferiority at never being the same as other people.

At the age of sixteen, I was invited to spend the summer with an aunt
and I, very delightedly, accepted the invitation. It was a small
town---Liberty, Indiana. When I came to my aunt, she knew that I had had
an unhappy childhood, and she said, "Now, Ethel, you're welcome to have
boy friends in our home, but there are two boys in this town that I
don't want you to date, and one of them comes from a very fine family,
one of the best. But he's in all sorts of scrapes because he drinks too
much." Four months later, I married this guy. I'm sure his family felt
that it was a marriage that---well, I was a girl from the wrong side of
the tracks---definitely!

I felt that his family were accepting me because it was good sense. I
could do something for their Russ. But they didn't do anything for me to
build up my ego. And Russ didn't tell me he'd stop drinking, and he
certainly didn't stop. It went on and grew worse and worse. We had two
daughters. I was sixteen when we were married and he was seven years
older. I remember one instance when he took off and went down to
Cincinnati and was gone for a week on a drunk.

Finally, it got so bad that I left him and went back home and took my
two children with me. I didn't see him for a year, or even hear from
him. That was seven or eight years after we were married. I was still
bitter because I felt that drink had completely ruined my childhood and
my married life, and I hated everything pertaining to it. I was about
twenty-five then, and I had never touched a drop.

I got a job in the woolen mills in Ravena---very hard work. I looked
much older than I was, I was always large, and I went back to work in
this job. I kept my children with me. At the end of a year, the children
got a card from their father, which I still have and

cherish. He said, "Tell Mommy I still love her." I had gone to an
attorney to see about getting a divorce during that year.

Then he came into town on the bum. He had taken up light work, and he
had a safety valve and a pair of spurs and the clothes on his back, and
that was all. I welcomed him with open arms. I didn't realize how I
still felt about him. He told me that he would never drink again. And I
believed him. As many times as he would tell me that, I still believed
him. Partially so, anyway. He got a job and went back to work.

He stayed "dry" for thirteen years! Dr. Bob often said that it was a
record for what he felt was a typical alcoholic.

We built up a splendid life. At the end of those thirteen years I never
dreamed that he'd ever take another drink. I had never taken one. Our
oldest daughter got married; they were living at our house. Our other
daughter was in her last year of high school, and one night the new
son-in-law and my husband went out to the prize fight. I never was
concerned anymore, anywhere he went. He hardly ever went to anything
like that without me. We were together all the time, but this night I
got up and saw it was late. I heard my son-in-law coming upstairs, and I
asked him where dad was. He had a very peculiar look on his face, and he
said, "He's coming." He was coming, on his hands and knees, up the
stairs. As I look back, I was very broken up about it. But I don't
believe now that it was with any deep feeling of resentment that I said
to him, "The children are raised, and if this is the way you want it,
this is the way we'll have it. Where

you go, I'll go, and what you drink, I'll drink." That's when I started
drinking.

We were the most congenial drinkers you ever saw. We never rowed or
fought. We had the grandest time ever. We just loved it. We'd start out
on the craziest trips. He'd always say, "Take me for a ride, Ma." So,
sometimes we'd end up in Charleston, West Virginia, or here or there,
drinking all along the way. These vacations became quite something, and
he always had two weeks vacation the first two weeks of every September.

One year we got as far as Bellaire, Ohio. We always started out on the
Saturday before Labor Day. I'm pretty near afraid of Labor Day yet. One
Sunday afternoon, the only time I ever got picked up for drunken
driving, I got picked up in Bellaire. They threw us in the jail. I
wasn't nearly in the condition I had been in many times to be picked up.
I really wasn't very high. They called the Mayor in so we wouldn't have
to stay in there over the holiday. He took his one hundred and seventeen
dollars and let us go, and we proceeded. That to me was the greatest
humiliation, to think that I'd finally landed in jail. My husband said
that I said, "Can you imagine them giving us that jail fare?" And he
said, "What jail fare?" And I said, "Well, they brought a pitcher of
coffee, and a sandwich wrapped up for me." And he said, "That wasn't
jail fare. They didn't give me anything to eat. Somebody must have taken
pity on you and gone out and got it for you." And another thing, it's a
wonder they didn't throw us back in because I could become very
dignified and sarcastic. As we left, and they were escorting us across
the bridge into Wheeling, I,

with great dignity and sarcasm, told them if their wives were ever
visiting in Akron, and they, too, were looking for their route signs as
I was, that I hoped that I could extend to them the hospitality that had
been shown to me in Bellaire.

The next time vacation time rolled around that was a bitter lesson to
us. Of course, this year we were drinking heavier and heavier and we
decided on staying home and being sensible, doing a little drinking, and
painting the house. So, on that Saturday before Labor Day, I got drunk
and set the house on fire---so we didn't have to paint it. I think that
was the last vacation before sobriety.

I hated myself worse and worse, and as I hated myself I became more
defiant towards everything and everybody. We drank with exactly the same
accord that we finally accepted A.A. We comforted each other.

My defiant attitude became worse. There was a very religious family that
lived down the road from us, and we were on the same party line. I'd
hear them on the phone having prayer meetings and so forth, that sort of
talk over the phone, and it completely burnt me up. They used a sound
truck some. It would stop out in front of our house, and I still believe
those people sent it! They'd sit out there and play hymns and I'd be
lying in there with a terrific hangover. If I'd had a gun I'd have shot
the horns right off the thing, because it made me raving mad.

It was just about this time, in 1940, that we met up with A.A. Russ read
a piece in the paper, and he kind of snickered, and said, "See here,
where John D. has found something to keep him from drinking!" "What's

that?" I said. "Oh, some darn thing they've got here in the paper about
it." We talked about it afterwards, and we felt that there might be some
time we'd need it. It was a thought that there might be some hope for
us.

One morning after a terrific drinking bout, I was in a little bar near
our house, and I shook so that I was very much ashamed, because I was
getting the shakes worse and worse. I sipped the drink off the bar
because I couldn't hold it in my hand, but I was still a lady, believe
it or not, and I was deeply ashamed. There was a man watching, and I
turned to him and said, with a defiant air I carried with me all the
time, "If I don't quit this I'm going to have to join that alcoholic
business they're talking about." He said, "Sister, if you think you're a
screwball now, all you have to do is join up with that. I'll get you the
password, and I can find out where they meet because I know a guy that
belongs. But they are the craziest bunch! They roll on the floor and
holler, and pull their hair." "Well, I'm nuts enough now," I said to
him. But right then the hope died that had been in my heart when we read
about John D.

Time went on and the drinking got worse and worse, and I was in another
barroom, down the road the other way, a small one, and I took my
glass---that morning I'd been able to lift it from the bar---and I said
to the woman behind the bar, "I wish I might never take another drop of
that stuff. It's killing me." She said, "Do you really mean that?" I
said, "Yes." She said, "Well, you better talk to Jack." (Jack was the
owner of the place. We always tried to buy him a drink, and he always
told us he had liquor trouble---couldn't drink.)

She said to me, "You know, he used to own the Merry-Go-Round. He used to
drink, and then he found something that started up in Akron that helped
him quit drinking." Right away, I saw it was the same outfit this other
guy told me about, and then again hope died.

Finally, one morning, I got up and got in the car and cried all the way
down to the M.'s---the people who owned the bar---and told her I was
licked and wanted help. I thought, "No matter how crazy they are I'll do
anything they say to do." I drove these three or four miles down the
road only to find that Jack was out. (This was funny. They owned this
joint, she ran it, and he sold for a brewery. That was his job. And he'd
been dry a year. I don't think Jack was hospitalized. I think his entry
into A.A. was through spending some hours with Dr. Bob at his office. He
brought many people into A.A. through his barroom.) Mrs. M. said she
would send Jack over as quick as he came in.

He came with two cans of beer. He gave my husband one and me one about
ten-thirty on the eighth day of May in 1941. He said, "There's a doctor
here in Akron. I'm going in to see him, and see what can be done." Dr.
Bob was in Florida, but Jack didn't know that.

That was our last drink of anything alcoholic. That nasty little can of
beer! At two-forty-five that morning I thought I would die. I lay across
the bed on my stomach with nothing but pain and sickness. I was scared
to death to call a doctor. I thought when people did what we did that
they just locked them up. I

didn't know that anything was ever done for them in a medical way. So I
stayed awake.

Men from A.A. started coming out to the house the next day. I paced the
floor with a bath towel around my shoulders, the perspiration running
off me. An attorney sat at the side of the bed where I was lying, and he
sat on the edge of his chair and looked as innocent as a baby. I
thought, "That guy never could have been drunk." He said, "This is my
story,"---real prim. And I thought, "I bet he's a sissy. I bet he never
drank." But he told a story of drinking that was amazing to me.

Jack brought the Saturday Post with Jack Alexander's story. He said,
"Read this." Jack didn't seem to have too much of the spiritual
understanding. He said, "I think this will tell you more. This is based,
really, on the Sermon on the Mount. Now, if you've got a Bible
around..." One of our gifts from the family was a very lovely Bible, but
we'd let the bulldog chew it because we weren't too interested in it. I
had a little Testament, which was very small print. When you have a
hangover and can't even sit still, try to read small print! Russ said,
"Mother, if this tells us how to do it, you'll have to read it." And I'd
try, but I couldn't even see the letters. But it was so important that
we do the things we were told to do! Jack said there was a meeting in
Akron every Wednesday night and that it was very important that we go.
Jack said, "Now you start and go to these meetings, and then you'll find
out all about it." I don't think that there was anything said about
religion. I didn't know anything about the Sermon on the Mount.

I had the Big Book (Alcoholics Anonymous) that

had been brought to me. Paul S. had just called me, and I remember he
stressed reading the Big Book. I was reading it for all that was in it,
and I said to Russ, "We can't do this. We couldn't begin to." And Jim G.
had such a wonderful sense of humor, and when he came I was in tears,
and I told him, "I want to do this, but I can't. This is too much. I
could never go and make up to all the people I've done wrong to." He
said, "Let's put the Big Book away again, and when you read it again,
turn to the back and read some of the stories. Have you read those?" No,
I was all interested in this part that told you how to do it. That was
the only part I was interested in. And then he got us to laugh, which
was what we needed. When we went to bed my sides ached, and I said to my
husband, "I thought I would never laugh again, but I have laughed."

"Well," I said to dad, when the A.A. people kept coming with these
lovely cars and looked so nice, "I suppose the neighbors say, ' Now
those old fools must have up and died, but where's the hearse?'"

On Wednesday night Jack M. said, "You meet me at the Ohio Edison
Building, and I will take you to the meeting." And we went down through
the valley, and I remember ed reading about the Ku Klux Klan and how
they burnt crosses, and I thought, "God alone knows what we are getting
into this time!" I didn't know what they were going to do because he
didn't tell us much. So we came to King's School. And they introduced me
to Miriam and Annabelle. They told Annabelle to take me under her wing,
and I shall never forget how she sort of curled up her nose and said,
"They tell me you drink too." I often think how

that could have turned some people away, because there were no other
women alcoholics there then. And I said, "Why sure, that's what I'm here
for." And I was glad, and I have been ever since, that I said that. And
I wasn't resentful toward her, either.

There was a young fellow who led the meeting and that was a beautiful
thing to me. He talked about his wife taking his little boy away from
him because of his drinking, and how he got back together with them
through A.A., and we began feeling grateful right then that all these
things hadn't been taken from us. They opened with a little prayer, and
I thought it was very fine that we stood, all of us together, and closed
with the Lord's Prayer.

I'd like to say here how important it was to us then that we do all the
little things that people said were important, because later when Russ
was so sick that I had to hold him up, they had a meeting out at the
house. When we closed the meeting with the Lord's Prayer, Russ said,
"Mother, help me stand." This was after his illness. We were in A.A.
three and a half years when he was taken from me. We had never missed a
Wednesday night at King's School for a year. We had that record.

I always feel that our God consciousness was a steady growth after we
became associated with A.A. And we loved every minute of that
association. We had big picnics out at the house with A.A. We had
meetings at each other's homes and, of course, that was a grand place
for people to get together out there; they seemed to think so too.

I give a great deal of credit to Doc and Anne for changing our life.
They spent at least an evening a

week in our home out there for weeks and weeks. Sometimes saying very
little, but letting us say. Russ used to be very much pleased because
he'd say, "I think Dr. Bob thoroughly enjoys coming out here. He can
relax and it's quiet."

At that time they didn't let us know that people ever had trouble. I
mean slips. I remember sometime, it was possibly six months after we had
been going steadily to King 's School, that we were coming home from a
meeting and saw a car along the way, and a fellow in back drinking a
bottle of beer. And Russ said, "I would have sworn that was Jack M." The
next morning his wife came dragging him in before Russ went to work,
while I was getting breakfast. It had been Jack M. We wept and Russ
didn't go to work.

Jack had been sober about a year and a half. His wife was cussing him,
raving at him, "I just brought him over to show you what kind of a guy
he is! He wants to go to the hospital, and I'm not paying for the
hospital again!" We were so mad at her because she talked to him that
way. Russ said, "Don't do another thing today but help him. Do something
for him! If he thinks he needs to go to the hospital, I'll pay for him."
She said, "He's not going to the hospital, whether you pay for it or I
pay for it, he's not going!"

In the spiritual strength I had found, because of A.A., I finally felt
that I had made a complete surrender, that I had really turned my life
over that summer. I thought I had done that until Russ' second collapse,
and the doctor told me very candidly that he wasn't long for this world.
I knew then that I hadn't made a complete surrender, because I tried to
bargain with

the God I had found, and I said, "Anything but that! Don't do that to
me!"

Russ lived a year longer than they expected him to live, and in that
year he was in bed for at least six months. I can't express what A.A.
meant to us during that year. Before the end finally came, I had, I
guess, made the surrender because I finally had been able to say that I
would not mind too much. And I realize that there was one salvation for
me. Thank God I had no desire for a drink when he died.

There were two women in the St. Thomas Hospital at that time in a room.
(Russ was buried on Friday, and on Sunday afternoon Hilda S. had invited
me there to dinner Sunday night, and I didn't think I could do it. I
knew Doc and Anne were going to be there, and all of them thought it
would be good for me, but the first thing I did was to go to St. Thomas
and try to talk to those women.) I sat down on the side of one of their
beds, and I started to weep, and I couldn't stop, and I was so started
to weep, and I couldn't stop, and I was startled, and I apologized again
and again for it. And that woman told me long after that was the surest
proof to her that this program could work. If, on Sunday, I could be
there, trying to think of something that would help her with this
problem, then we must have something that could work. I felt it
certainly must be very depressing to her that I should sit there by her
bedside and cry.

I feel that one of the things that I still have to guard against is that
I used to be set in my way about what I considered the old-time A.A. I
have to tell myself, "Other things are progressing and A.A. must too."
We old-timers who get scattered and separated and then witness the
construction of services to get in more

people and to make this thing function, we think that A.A. has changed,
but the root of it hasn't. We are older in A.A., and we're older in
years. It's only natural that we don't have the capacity to change, but
we ought not to criticize those who have.

There's another thing I would stress. I think it's awfully hard on
people, especially if they're new people, to hear these long drawn --
out talks. I don't ever remember that I was bored myself when we first
came in, and they came out to the house and talked to us about these
things. I ate up every bit of it, because I wanted to find out how to
stay sober.

Before I stop---I always was a great talker---I want to say that nobody
will ever know how I miss Annie's advice about things. I would get in
the biggest dither about something. I hadn't been in too long when one
of the men's wives called me one Sunday and told me she didn't think I
had any part of the program. Well, I wasn't sure I did, and it was awful
foggy, and I wept and asked her what she thought I ought to do about it.
She said she didn't know, but that I sure showed plain enough I didn't
have any part of it. I didn't think I was going to get drunk right then,
but I remember how comforting it was then, but I remember how comforting
it was when I called Anne and told her. I was crying, and I said, "Alice
says she knows I don't have any part of the program." She talked to me
and laughed about it and got me all over it. Another thing that was
helpful to me. I used to think I was cowardly because when things came
out pertaining to the program that troubled me, I said to her many
times, "Annie, am I being a coward because I lay those things away on
the shelf and skip it?" She said, "I feel you're just being wise. If it
isn't anything that's

going to help you or anybody else, why should you become involved in it,
and get all disturbed about it?"

So there you are. That's my story. I know I've talked too long, but I
always do. And, anyhow, if I went on for ten or a hundred times as long
I couldn't even begin to tell you all that A.A. has meant to me.

## Gentleman

I WAS BORN in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1889, the last child of a family of
eight children. My parents were hard working people. My father was a
railroad man and a Civil War veteran. I can remember that in my
childhood, he was ill at ease with the children because he attempted to
assert an army discipline that had been ground into him during his three
and a half years of army service. The differences between my father and
my sisters, who were school teachers, made an excellent environment for
the type of child I was---that is, slick and cute enough to take
advantage of any adult quarrel. In other words, I was always safe from
the discipline of my father, and, having developed along that line, I
had considerable difficulty in school. Rules were made for others, but
not for me. Of course, it was always my aim to have my own way without
being caught.

My mother was eighty-nine years old when she died, and I was a
full-blown alcoholic at the time of her death. She was a woman devoted
to her family and loyal to her husband, but quarrels did not make a
happy environment for her. I had four brothers and three sisters. As I
look back, all the brothers developed personality problems. The sisters
seemed to remain unaffected. I seemed to react by developing a streak of
varying meanness, which would cause me to do things to create excitement
and to get attention. I very early sampled the effects of alcohol. In
fact, on one occasion, I was picked up by the police and brought home. I
was then about sixteen years old. I didn't go to high school. I went to
five grade schools, primarily because I was expelled for my conduct, but
I eventually graduated from the eighth grade.

I was always interested in mechanics and after having about twenty
miscellaneous jobs, lasting from one day to two weeks, I obtained a job
as a toolmaker apprentice. Being intensely interested in the work, I
changed my conduct sufficiently to master the job. I finished my
apprenticeship and was moved into the drafting department. That was in
Cleveland. As a draftsman, I worked for several large companies and
gained a variety of experience. Not far from where I lived they built a
new technical high school and one of the teachers sold me on the idea
that I needed a little mechanical drawing if I were going to be a good
toolmaker. I proceeded to take up the drawing and advanced rapidly in
it. The school then obtained a job for me in the drafting department of
another company. After I was on the drafting board about two years I
decided I wanted a technical education. I was then about eighteen. I did
not have a high school education so I went to night school to take the
full high school course, which I finished in two years and nine months.
I apparently was willing to subdue these personality disturbances in a
tremendous drive to succeed. I had an objective. I could discipline
myself but along

the way there would be festivities and occasions when I got drunk.
Although, during this period I was not addicted to any pattern of
alcohol consumption, when I did drink the drinking was pretty wild.

I then entered Case School and worked while I went to school and
finished there. This was an engineering college. Following graduation, I
was offered a pretty good job which I took. In the fall of the
graduating year, I became involved in some litigation over the ownership
of inventions and patents. This experience sent me to law school where I
went at night and which course I completed in less than three years,
taking the highest state bar examinations and passing them. The law
school experience was not inspired by a desire to follow patent law,
which has been my profession since: I went to law school primarily to
learn the law of contracts following my own experience with litigation.
A year later, after I completed the course in contracts, I quit the law
school, and undertook some engineering work for a patent law firm on
behalf of clients who were in diffculties and who desired to keep their
troubles from their own engineering department. This work consumed a
period of about two-thirds of a year, and worked out successfully so I
decided to follow patent law. I went back to law school, and doubled up
on the courses because I was then approaching thirty years of age and I
wanted to get through as quickly as possible. I was supporting myself
through all this education by being a toolmaker and a draftsman.

I married when I was twenty-eight years old, and started in law school
after I was married. As a matter

of fact, I had two children at the time I was admitted to the bar.

I kept myself so busy that, outside of some school and group parties, I
didn't go overboard on drinking very much between the ages of
twenty-five and thirty. My life was fairly well crowded and I didn't
seem to need any stimulants to keep me going. By the time I had
completed law school I had picked up some experience in patent law, for
I remained with the patent law firm and worked too in Washington where
they found that I was a capable infringement investigator. In 1924, I
had acquired enough clients of my own so that the firm made me a junior
partner. My drinking career began about four years after I had moved up
into partnership and had joined certain clubs, societies and so forth,
and during which period we had Prohibition. I was then about
thirty-seven or thirty-eight.

All during Prohibition, every alcoholic felt that he made the best
hootch, regardless of how bad it was. I became a specialist in making
elderberry blossom wine.

There had been some occasions---there was an automobile wreck, for
instance---when I had police escort home but not to jail, all of which,
instead of doing me a favor, did me harm because I was then full of
self-esteem as to the progress I had made both professionally and
financially. The first definite indications of an alcoholic pattern
began to arise when I would go to New York on business and disappear,
and wind up in Philadelphia or Boston for two or three day periods. I
would have to return to New York and pick up my bills and bags. These
periods became more frequent

and I resolved that when I became forty, which was very shortly, I was
going on the wagon. Forty came and went and then the resolution was
advanced to forty-one, forty-two, and so on in the usual pattern. I
realized that I had a problem, although my realization was not very deep
because my own conceit wouldn't admit that I had any personality
problems. I could not see why I couldn't drink like a gentleman, and
that was my primary ambition---until I landed in A.A. This pattern
deepened and became worse. I became a constant drinker with a terrific
fight to control the amount of my consumption each day.

My practice had advanced to the point where it could stand a lot of
abuse and it got it. Whenever a situation arose that fast talk wouldn't
explain away, I simply withdrew. In other words, I fired the client
before the client fired me. I was willful, full of will to do things I
wanted to do and to get the things that I wanted to have.

Insofar as religion was concerned, I had Catholic training in my youth.
I went to both Catholic and public schools. I never left the church, but
I was a fringe member, and the thought simply never occurred to me that
through the exercise of what I had I might find the answer to my
problem, simply because I wouldn't admit that I had a problem. The
successful demonstration I had made of my life problems in other
respects convinced me that some day I was going to be able to drink like
a gentleman.

When I was about forty-seven, after indulging in all kinds of
self-deception to control my drinking, I arrived at a period when I felt
convinced I had to have so much alcohol every day and that the real
problem

was to control how much. After two or three years of effort along this
line, I reached the point of actual despair that I ever would be able to
drink only a harmless amount each day. And then my thinking became
calculation as to how much longer I had to live, how long the assets
would last. By that time, I had one boy in college, another a senior in
high school, and a daughter about twelve years old. My efficiency as a
professional man was probably reduced to twenty-five percent of what it
should have been.

I had two partners. They suffered from my conduct without saying
anything, but the reason for this was that I still managed to hang onto
a very substantial practice. They probably felt that it was useless,
that surely I had enough intelligence to know what I was doing. They
were wrong. They never raised the issue. In fact, as I look back, I have
often thought that they probably concluded that they would put up with
me for a couple of years, that I couldn't live much longer, and that
they would inherit whatever was left of the practice. That is not
unusual.

As far as my home was concerned, I did not see then, though of course I
can see now, that it was anything but a happy situation for my wife. My
children had lost respect for me and, in fact, it was only after three
or four years of sobriety that any of them ever said anything to me to
indicate that I had recouped even a little of their respect.

I was forty-nine and a half years old when I was first approached about
the Akron Group. It was not known to me as a group, but I later learned
that my wife had known about it for nine months and had prayed
constantly that I would stumble into Akron

some way or another. She knew that at that time any suggestion she made
about my drinking would only build up a barrier, a consideration for
which I am ever grateful. Had anyone undertaken to explain to me what
the A.A. movement was, what it's real function was, I probably would
have been set back several years and I doubt if I would have survived at
all.

So the story of my introduction into A.A. begins with the activities of
my wife. She had a hairdresser who used to tell her about a
brother-in-law who had been quite a drinker and about some doctor in
Akron who had straightened him out. My wife didn't tell me this, but one
Sunday afternoon when Mary was trying to get the cobwebs out of my mind,
Clarence and his sister-in-law, the hairdresser, called at the house. I
was introduced to them and Clarence proceeded to put on his Twelve Step
work. I was kind of shocked about anybody talking about themselves the
way he did, and my impression was that the guy was a little "touched."
However, on a couple of other occasions, Clarence seemed to bob up at
the last saloon that I would stop at on the way home every day. I
resented it of course, and I offered Clarence his commission, whatever
it might be, if he would please not bother me because I had arrived at
the conclusion that he was a solicitor for some alcoholic institute. One
evening I had gone out after dinner to take on a couple of
double-headers and stayed a little later than usual, and when I came
home Clarence was sitting on the davenport with Bill W. I do not
recollect the specific conversation that went on but I believe I did
challenge Bill to tell me something about A.A. and I do recall one other
thing: I wanted to know what this was that

worked so many wonders, and hanging over the mantel was a picture of
Gethsemane and Bill pointed to it and said, "There it is," which didn't
make much sense to me. There was also some conversation about Dr. Bob
and I must have said that I would go down to Akron with Bill in the
morning.

The next morning, my wife came into my room and wakened me and said,
"That man is downstairs and he said you said you'd go to Akron." I said,
"Did I say that?" She said. "Well, he wouldn't be here if you didn't say
so." And being a big-shot man of my word, I said, "Well, if I said so,
then I'll go." That's about the spirit in which I went to Akron. Bill
bought me a drink or two on the way, and Dorothy S. came with us, and
the three of us went over to the City Hospital. We drove my car and I
left it down in the yard. Bill left me at the elevator and said, "Your
room is so and so," and I didn't see him again for six months. The
interne came along with a glassful of bleached lightning that put me
away for about fifteen hours. I went into the hospital in April, 1939.

My experience in the hospital I considered to be terrific because Dr.
Bob told me very quickly that medicine would have very little to do with
it, outside of trying to restore my appetite for food. I had had no
hospitalization up to this time because I would not call doctors when I
was getting over a bad one. I would use barbiturates. In fact, the last
three years of my drinking was a routine of barbiturates in the morning,
so that I could stop shaking enough to shave, and then alcohol beginning
about four-thirty or five o'clock, with a struggle not to take a drink
at noon or during the day, because I had the idea that if I took

one drink, I would smell as though I had a pint.

Dr. Bob did not lay out the whole program. He startled me by informing
me that he was an alcoholic, that he had found a way which so far
enabled him to live without taking a drink, and that the main idea was
to find a way how not to take that first drink. He told me that there
were some other fellows that had tried this with success, and if I cared
to see any of them he'd have them come in to see me. I believe every
member of the Akron Group did come to see me, which impressed me
terrifically, not so much because of the stories they told, but because
they would take the time to come and talk to me without even knowing who
I was. I did not know there was such a thing as group activity until I
left the hospital. I left on a Wednesday afternoon, had dinner in Akron
and then went to a house where I encountered my first meeting. I had
attended several of these meetings before I discovered that all those
who were there were not alcoholics. That is, it was sort of a mixed
bunch of Oxford Groupers, who were interested in the alcoholic problem,
and of alcoholics themselves. My reaction to those meetings was good. In
fact, I never lost my faith, since I had been prepared by some
conversations toward the end of my sojourn in the hospital with Dr. Bob,
conversations pretty much along spiritual lines. There was one
experience with Doc which made a terrific impression upon me. The
afternoon that I was to leave the hospital, he came in to see me and
asked me if I were willing to attempt to follow the program. I told him
that I had no other intention. That was at the end of eight days in
which I had had no liquor. He then pulled up his chair with one of his

knees touching mine and said, "Will you pray with me for your success?"
And he then said a beautiful prayer. That was an experience that I have
never forgotten, and many times in my own work with A.A. newcomers I
feel kind of guilty because I haven't done the same thing.

One of the things that came up repeatedly in the stories they told me
was that once they had accepted the program, they never had a desire to
take a drink. That was skeptically recieved by me when I first heard it,
but after some twenty-eight or thirty fellows had come to see me, and
pretty nearly all of them had said the same thing, I began to believe
it. In my own experience I was so jubilant at finding myself sober, and
I had so many things to catch up on, that a month went by before the
thought even occurred to me. I had a genuine release right from the
start. I've never had a desire to take a drink.

Doc dwelt on the idea that this was an illness, but Doc was pretty frank
with me. He found that I had enough faith in the Almighty to be fairly
frank. He pointed out to me that probably it was more of a moral or
spiritual illness than it was a physical one.

We went to Akron for about six weeks and we did a lot of visiting among
the people in Akron. There were, at that time, in the neighborhood of
twelve or thirteen Cleveland members who had been sober anywhere from a
year and a half to a couple of months. They had all been to Akron. It
was finally decided to undertake the organization of a Cleveland group
and toward the end of May, 1939, the first meeting was held in Cleveland
in my home. At that meeting, there were a number of Akron people and all
the Cleveland people.

Professionally, after I was sober for a month or so I realized that I
should school myself to dissolve the partnership I was in because I felt
that I would never regain the respect of my partners no matter how long
I was sober, and that I would be at a disadvantage. I still had enough
practice to earn a good living if I would only work, so I resolved that
in January of 1940 I would launch a patent law firm of my own.

Shortly after I came to this conclusion, I was importuned by another
well-known patent law firm to help them out on some trial work because
their trial man had had a heart attack and had been forbidden to go into
the courtroom. Somewhere in one of the conversations, I mentioned that I
was comtemplating forming a new firm. On hearing that, these people
induced me to make the move immediately and join them as a senior
partner, which I did. I found in the fall of 1939, that I was not
mentally impaired, so far as trial work was concerned, and thereafter
took up where I had left off when I was about forty-five years old. My
physical health was badly shaken, but I began to pick up. In fact, after
six months of living on food instead of on whiskey, I gained about
thirty pounds.

I realized that there wasn't anything I could say to place myself in a
more favorable light with my children, that it was going to be a matter
of time; for I also understood the intolerance of young people towards
deficiencies in their elders. I believe though that it helped my family
tremendously to have the A.A. meetings every week in my own home. My
oldest child sometimes sat in on the meetings.

I had accepted Catholicism somewhat as an inheritance. My education had
been pretty much pagan---science. I resolved that if I were going to
continue with the Catholic Church, I was going to know the roots of the
doctrine, since those roots had caused me some confusion. So I enrolled
at the university for night courses in religion, and I pursued those
courses for a year. In summing up, I can say that A.A. has made me, I
hope, a real Catholic.

## Hawk

This newsman covered life from top to bottom; but he ended up, safely
enough, in the middle.

WITH NOTHING but a liberal arts education, very definitely estranged
from my family and already married, soon after graduation from college I
became a bookmaker's clerk on the British racing circuits, far better
off financially than the average professional man. I moved in a gay
crowd in the various "pubs" and sporting clubs. My wife traveled with
me, but with a baby coming I decided to settle in a large city where I
got a job with a commission agent which is a polite term for a hand-book
operator. My job was to collect bets and betting-slips in the business
section, a lucrative spot. My boss, in his way, was "big business."
Drinking was all in the day's work.

One evening, the book, after checking up, was very definitely in the red
for plenty through a piece of studied carelessness on my part, and my
boss, very shrewd and able, fired me with a parting statement to the
effect that once was enough. With a good stake I sailed for New York. I
knew I was through among the English "bookies."

Tom Sharkey's brawling bar in 14th Street and the famous wine-room at
the back were headquarters for me. I soon ran through my stake. Some
college friends got me jobs when I finally had to go to work, but I
didn't stick to them. I wanted to travel. Making my way to Pittsburg, I
met other former friends and got a job in a large factory where
peacemakers were making good money. My fellow-workers were mostly good
Saturday night drinkers and I was right with them. Young and able to
travel with the best of them, I managed to hold my job and keep my end
up in the barrooms.

I quit the factory and got a job on a small newspaper, going from that
to a Pittsburgh daily, long ago defunct. Following a big drunk on that
sheet, where I was doing leg-work and rewrite, a feeling of nostalgia
made me buy a ticket for Liverpool and I returned to Britain.

During my visit there, renewing acquaintance with former friends, I soon
spent most of my money. I wanted to roam again and through relatives got
a supercargo job on an Australian packet which allowed me to visit my
people in Australia where I was born. But I didn't stay long. I was soon
back in Liverpool. Coming out of a pub near the Cunard pier I saw the
Lusitania standing out in the middle of the mersey. She had just come in
and was scheduled to sail into days.

In my mind's eye I saw Broadway again and Tom Sharkey's bar; the roar of
the subway was in my ears. Saying goodbye to my wife and baby, I was
treading Manhattan's streets in a little more than a week. Again I spent
my bankroll, by no means as thick as the one I had when I first saw the
skyline of Gotham. I was soon broke, this time without trainfare to go
anywhere. I got my first introduction to "riding the rods and making a
blind."

In my eary twenties the hardships of hobo life did not discourage me,
but I had no wish to become just a tramp. Forced to detrain from an
empty gondola on the other side of Chicago by a terrific rainstorm which
drenched me to the skin, I hit the first factory building I saw for a
job. That job began a series of brief working spells, each one ending in
a "drunk" and the urge to travel. My migrations extended for over a year
as far west as Omaha. Drifting back to Ohio, I landed on a small
newspaper and later was impressed into the direction of boy-welfare work
at the local "Y." I stayed sober for four years except for a one-night
carousal in Chicago. I stayed so sober that I used to keep a quart of
medicinal whiskey in my bureau which I used to taper off the occasional
newspaper alcoholics who were sent to see me.

Lots of times, vain-gloriously, I used to take the bottle out, look at
it and say, "I've got you licked."

The war was getting along. Curious about it, feeling I was missing
something, absolutely without any illusions about the aftermath, with no
pronounced feeling of patriotism, I joined up with a Canadian regiment,
serving a little over two years. Slight casualties, complicated however
by a long and serious illness, were my only mishaps. Remarkably enough,
I was a very abstemious soldier. My four years of abstinence had
something to do with it, but soldiering is a tough enough game for a
sober man, and I had no yen for full-pack slogging through mud with a
cognac or vin rouge hangover.

Discharged in 1919, I really made up for my dry spell. Quebec, Toronto,
Buffalo, and finally Pittsburgh, were the scenes of man-sized drunks
until I

had gone through my readjusted discharge pay, a fair sum.

I again became a reporter on a Pittsburgh daily. I applied for a
publicity job and got it. My wife came over from Scotland and we started
housekeeping in a large Ohio city.

The new job lasted five years. Every encouragement was given me with
frequent salary increases, but the sober times between "periods" became
shorter. I myself could see deterioration in my work from being
physically and mentally affected by liquor, although I had not yet
reached the point where all I wanted was more to drink. Successive
Monday morning hangovers, which despite mid-week resolutions to do
better, came with unfailing regularity, eventually caused me to quit my
job. Washington, D.C. and news-gathering agency work followed, along
with many parties. I couldn't stand the pace. My drinking was never the
spaced doses of the careful tippler; it was always gluttonous.

Returning to the town I had left three months before, I became editor of
a monthly magazine, soon had additional publicity and advertising
accounts and the money rolled in. The strain of overwork led me to the
bottle again. My wife made several attempts to get me to stop and I had
the usual visits from persons who would always ask me "Why?"---as if I
knew! Offered the job of advertising manager for an eastern automotive
company, I move to Philadelphia to begin life anew. In three months John
Barleycorn had me kicked out.

I did six years of newspaper advertising, and trade journal work with
many, many drunks of drab and

dreary hue woven into the pattern of my life. I visited my family just
once in that time. An old avocation, the collecting of first editions,
rare books and Americana, fascinated me between times. I had some
financial success through no ability of my own and, when jobless and
almost wiped out in 1930, I began to trade and sell my collections; much
of the proceeds went to keep my apartment stocked with liquor and almost
every night saw me helpless to bed.

I tried to help myself. I even began to go the rounds of the churches. I
listened to famous ministers---found nothing. I began to know the inside
of jails and work-houses. My family would have nothing to do with me, in
fact couldn't because I couldn't spare any of my money, which I needed
for drink, to support them. My last venture, a book shop, was hastened
to closed doors by my steady intoxication. Then I had an idea.

Loading a car with good old books to sell to collectors, librarians,
universities and historical societies, I started out to travel the
country. I stayed sober during the trip except for an occasional bottle
of beer because funds barely met expenses. When I hit Houston, Texas, I
found employment in a large bookstore. Need I say that in a very short
time I was walking along a prairie highway with arm extended and thumb
pointed? In the two succeeding years I held ten different jobs ranging
from newspaper copy-desk and rewrite, to traffic director for an oil
field equipment company. Always, in between, there were intervals of
being broke, riding freights and hitch-hiking interminable distances
from one big town to another in three states. Now on a new job I was
always thinking

about payday and how much liquor I could buy and the pleasure I could
have.

I knew I was a drunkard. Enduring all hangover hells that every
alcoholic experiences, I made the usual resolutions. My thoughts
sometimes turned to the idea that three must be a remedy. I have stood
listening to street-corner preachers tell how they beat the game. They
seemed to be happy in their fashion, they and their little groups of
supporters, but always pride of intellect stopped me from seeking what
they evidently had. Sniffing at emotional religion, I walked away. I was
an honest agnostic, but definitely not a hater of the church or its
adherents. What philosophy I had was thoroughly paganistic---all my life
was devoted to a search for pleasure. I wanted to do nothing except what
it pleased me to do when I wanted to do it.

Federal Theatre in Texas gave me an administrative job which I held for
a year, only because I worked hard and productively when I worked, and
because my very tolerant chief ascribed my frequent lapses to a bohemian
temperament. When it was closed through Washington edict I began with
Federal Writers in San Antonio. In those days my system was always to
drink up my last pay check and believe that necessity would bring the
next job. A friend who knew I would soon be broke mounted guard over me
when I left my job of writing the histories of Texas cities and put me
aboard a bus for the town I had left almost five years before.

In five years a good many persons had forgotten that I had been somewhat
notorious. I arrived drunk, but I promised my wife I would keep sober,
and I

knew I could get work if I did. Of course I didn't keep sober. My wife
and family stood by me for ten weeks and then, quite justifiably,
ejected me. I managed to maintain myself with odd jobs, did ten weeks in
a social rescue institution, and at length wound up in a second-hand
bookstore in an adjacent town as manager. While there I was called to
the hospital in my home town to see a former partner who had insisted
that I visit him. I found my friend was there for alcoholism and now he
was insisting that he had found the only cure. I listened to him, rather
tolerantly. I noticed a Bible on his table and it amazed me. I had never
known him to be anything but a good healthy pagan with a propensity for
getting into liquor jams and scrapes. As he talked I gathered vaguely,
(because he was a faltering beginner then, just as I am now) that to be
relieved of alcoholism I would have to be different.

Some days later, after he had been discharged, a stranger came into my
shop in the nearby town. He introduced himself and began to tell me
about a bunch of some sixty former drinkers and drunkards who met once a
week, and he invited me to go with him to the next meeting. I thanked
him, pleaded business engagements and promised I'd go with him at some
future date.

"Anyhow, I'm on the wagon now," I said. "I'm doing a job I like and it's
quiet where I live, practically no temptations. I don't feel bothered
about liquor."

He looked at me quizzically. He knew too well that didn't mean a thing,
just as I knew in my heart that it would be only a question of time---a
few days, a week, or even a month, it was inevitable---till I would be
off

on another bender. The time came just a week later. As I look back on
the events of two months, I can clearly see that I had been circling
around, half-afraid of encountering the remedy for my situation, half
wanting it, deferring fulfillment of my promise to get in touch with the
doctor I had heard about. An accident while drunk laid me low for about
three weeks. As soon as I could get up and walk I started to drink again
and kept it up until my friend of the hospital, who, in his first try at
the new way of life had stubbed his toe in Chicago but had come back to
the town to take counsel and make a new start, picked me up and got me
into a hospital.

I had been drinking heavily from one state of semicoma to another and it
was several days before I got "defogged," but subconsciously I was in
earnest about wanting to quit liquor forever. It was no momentart
emotionalism bornof self-pity in a maudlin condition. I was seeking
something and I was ready to learn. I did not need to be told that my
efforts were and would be unavailing if I did not get help. The doctor
who came to see me almost at once did not assail me with any new
doctrines; he made sure that I had a need and that I wanted to have that
need filled, and little by little I learned how my need could be met.
The story of Alcoholics Anonymous fascinated me. Singly and in groups of
two or three, they came to visit me. Some of them I had known for years,
good two-fisted drinkers who had disappeared from their former haunts. I
had missed them myself from the barrooms of the town.

There were businessmen, professional men, and factory workers. All sorts
were represented and their

relation of experiences and how they had found the only remedy, added to
their human existence as sober men, laid the foundation of a very
necessary faith. Indeed, I was beginning to see that I would require
implicit faith, like a small child, if I was going to get anywhere. The
big thing was that these men were all sober and evidently had something
I didn't have. Whatever it was, I wanted it.

I left the hospital on a meeting night. I was greeted warmly, honestly,
and with a true ring of sincerity by everyone present. That night I was
taken home by a former alcoholic and his wife. They did not show me to
my room and wish me a good night's rest. Instead, over coffee cups, this
man and his wife told me what had been done for them. They were earnest
and obviously trying to help me on the road I had chosen. They will
never know how much their talk with me helped. The hospitality of their
home and their fine fellowship were freely mine.

I had never, since the believing days of childhood, been able to
conceive an authority directing the universe. But I had never been a
flippant, wise-cracking sneerer at the few persons I had met who had
impressed me as Christian men and women, or at any institution whose
sincerity of purpose I could see. No conviction was necessary to
establish my status as a miserable failure at managing my own life. I
began to read the Bible daily and to go over a simple devotional
exercise as a way to begin each day. Gradually I began to understand.

I cannot say that my taste for liquor has entirely disappeared. It has
been that way with some, but it has not been with me and may never be.
Neither can

I honestly say that I have forgotten the "fleshpots of Egypt." I
haven't. But I can remember the urge of the Prodigal Son to return to
his Father.

Formerly, in the acute mental and physical pain during the remorseful
periods succeeding each drunk, I found my recollection of the misery I
had gone through a bolsterer of resolution and afterward, perhaps, a
deterrent for a time. But in those days I had no one to whom I might
take my troubles. Today I have. Today I have Someone who will always
hear me; I have a warm fellowship among men who understand my problems;
I have tasks to do and am glad to do them, to see others who are
alcoholics and to help them in any way I can to become sober men. I took
my last drink in 1937.

## Shown

"Who is convinced against his will is of the same opinion still." But
not this man.

I WAS THE OLDEST of three children, and my father was an alcoholic. One
of the earliest memories that I have is of a bottle sitting on his desk
with a skull and crossbones and marked "Poison." At that time, as I
remember, he had promised never to take another drink. Of course he did.
I can also remember that he was a salesman and a very good one. When he
was uptown---we were living in the little town of Moscow---I went up to
try to get some money from him to buy groceries. He wouldn't give me any
money for the groceries, but he did take me across the street and buy me
a bag of candy, which I later took back and traded for a loaf of bread.
I was not more than six at that time.

My father died in 1901 when I was eight years old and I was in the
second or third grade at school. I immediately quit school and went to
work, and from that time until I was high school age there was never a
return to school. I always built up in my own mind the great things that
I was going to do, and in fact I accomplished about fifty per cent of
them and then lost interest. That continued through my entire life. When
I was sixteen years old, my mother remarried and I was given the
opportunity of going back to school. I went into the high school grades,
but having missed all the intermediate grades, I didn't get along too
well, so I developed the habit of going back to school just long enough
for the football season and then quitting.

There was always a tremendous drive and ambition to become a great guy,
because I think I recognized inwardly that I didn't have any special
talents. At a comparatively early age, I can remember being jealous of
my brother. He did things much better than I did because he applied
himself and learned how to do them, and I never applied myself. Whether
I could have done as well as he, I don't know.

I was married at the age of nineteen to a grand girl and had good
business prospects. I had bought a piece of ground in Cuyahoga Falls and
cut it into lots and had a profit of approximately \$40,000 and that was
a lot of money in those days. With that profit, I built a number of
houses, but then I neglected them. I wouldn't put sufficient time on
them. Consequently, my labor bills ran up. I lost money, and then just
fooled away a large part of the profit.

When I was eighteen, at the end of high school, the high school team had
a banquet at a well-known roadhouse outside of Akron. We boys drove out
in somebody's car and went to the bar on the way to the dining room and
I, in an effort to impress the other boys that I was city-bred, having
lived in Scranton and Cleveland, asked them if they didn't want to
drink. They looked at one another queerly and, finally, one of them
allowed he'd have a beer and they all followed him, each of them saying
he'd have a beer too. I ordered a martini, extra dry. I didn't even know
what a martini looked like, but I had heard a man down the bar order
one. That was my first drink. I kept watching the man down the bar to
see what he did with a contraption like that, and he just smelled of his
drink and set it down again, so I did the same. He took a couple of
puffs of a cigarette and I took a couple of puffs of my cigarette. He
tossed off half of his martini; I tossed off half of mine and it nearly
blew the top of my head off. It irritated my nostrils; I choked, I
didn't like it. There was nothing about that drink that I liked. But I
watched him, and he tossed off the rest of his, so I tossed off the rest
of mine. He ate his olive and I ate mine. I didn't even like the olive.
It was repulsive to me from every standpoint. I drank nine martinis in
less than an hour.

Twenty-two years later, Doctor Bob told me that what I had done was like
turning a switch and setting up a demand for more alcohol in my system.
I didn't know that then. I had no more reason to drink those martinis
than a jackrabbit. At that particular time, the boys put me on a shutter
and took me out to the shed, and I lay in the car while they enjoyed
their banquet. That was the first time I ever drank hard liquor.
Blackout drinking at once. I had no pleasure out of the drinking at all.
All of a sudden I found myself guzzling. Right then I determined that
never so long as I lived would I have anything more to do with martinis.
They acted on me like the beating of a club.

I think it was probably more than a year before I had anything more to
do with liquor. I was opening up these lots that I spoke of. I had a
crew of men working there and I wanted them to work Sunday afternoons so
that I could sell lots on Sunday. I went over and bought a jug of hard
cider and a gallon of wine that I gave these fellows to drink. When they
got through the day's work, part was left which I proceeded to drink.
During the day, looking over the contracts and money in my pocket, I
found that I had sold six lots that I couldn't even remember, and didn't
even know the people I had sold them to. I had to look in the telephone
book later to find out who these people were. Another blackout. Wine and
hard cider.

I early discovered that if I drank anything, I was not accountable for
what happened. I decided that I couldn't drink. Anyhow, I recognized the
fact that I couldn't drink like normal people, but I tried hard and kept
on trying for twenty-two years.

I sold three lots to an elderly lady in Cleveland. I came to Cleveland
with the deeds to these lots and to pick up my money. She paid me in
cash. The next morning I woke up in jail in Cleveland and the jailor had
\$1,175 of my money in an envelope. I didn't remember anything that had
happened. This was six or eight months after the last drinking episode.

Then I got married. (As I've said, I was nineteen). I felt having gotten
married, I was an adult and one of the first things I did was to buy two
cases of whiskey with no idea of drinking it. (I might say right here
that never in my life did I ever intend to get drunk. I never had any
desire to get drunk. So I consciously thought). I was a very young
married man, having his whiskey in the cupboard over the sink, and when
I helped my wife with the dishes at night I would take a cup of tea and
spike it with whiskey. I could get through an evening with just a couple
of snorts.

This was a regular occurrence for a little while. Eventually, there
would be a ball game, or a show, or some sort of special occasion to
celebrate and I would turn up drunk. About that period, too, came
increasing procrastination and the avoidance of responsibilities. I
would put off doing anything that I could until the next day and,
consequently, everything would pile up and then there would be the
blackout.

At the end of this selling of lots, just prior to World War I, I got
into the crude rubber business, and six months later there was only one
broker and myself left in Akron. So in spite of anything that I might
do, I prospered, being one of only two brokers in the rubber center of
the world.

I found, however, that when I would leave Akron to go to Chicago, I
would get drunk. As long as there was everyday business, I could drink
occasionally and didn't always get drunk. I was a periodic. A big event
of any kind precipitated heavy drinking. It had long since become a
serious problem. I was prone to do everything on a big scale. I can well
remember sitting with seven dollors in my pocket, planning on giving my
family a hundred or two hundred dollors, when I made it next year. But I
didn't do a thing about giving them any part of the seven bucks I had in
my pocket.

The rubber prosperity went on for about six years---1916 to 1922. It
fell apart in the twenties. Every company in the country, except
Firestone, was reorganized at that time. I was always able to skate
along the fringe of big money. I made a point of knowing important
people. I could work a deal up to where all I had to do was to go ahead
with it; all the planning had been done, all the financing had been
done, but then I'd say, "Nuts to it!" and walk away. Near success, only
near. I figured the only difference between me and a millionaire was
that I hadn't the strength, or that he got the breaks and I didn't.

Akron was really on the boom in those days, 1919-1920; expansion was
terrific. I optioned a piece of land just off East Market Street to put
up a three-hundred suite apartment. One hundred for unmarried women at
one end, one hundred for men at the other, and one hundred for married
couples in the middle. In the basement were to be dry-cleaning
facilities, a barbershop, a pool room, a grocery shop and everything. I
had contracted for half of it, at least verbally, and the contractors
were taking half of the second mortgage bond. At that particular stage,
I lost interest in it, sold the option for \$5,000 and forgot the whole
deal. Another time, I had a rubber pool project. My idea was to have all
the companies pool their funds and buy rubber when rubber was cheap and
then put it in a pool. When rubber reached a certain low point, they
would draw on the rubber out of the pool and buy. With the big
companies, and with the amount of money we could have gotten and the
promises I had, it could have been done. I worked along until I had
really big names in rubber on a tentative contract, and then I neglected
to go through with it.

To my mind, drinking didn't have anything to do with not going through
with things. I don't know whether I drank to cover up being a failure,
or whether I drank and then missed the deals. I was able to rationalize
it anyway. I can well remember over a long period of years when I
thought I was the only person in the world who knew that sooner or later
I was going to get drunk. I can remember occasions when friends
recommended me for positions or business opportunities that I wouldn't
take because I felt that at some future date I'd get drunk and they
would be hurt.

In the meantime, the domestic situation was not getting along too well.
We had two children, a boy and a girl, and when the boy was about
twelve, we broke up the marriage. That was at my suggestion. I can
remember telling the poor little soul that I could probably quit
drinking if I wasn't married to her, and told her that, after all, I
didn't like restraint! I didn't like having to come home at a certain
time; I didn't like this, I didn't like that, and I think the poor girl
acually divorced me to help me stop drinking! Naturally, what little
restraint I had exercised before was gone now, and my drinking became
worse.

Long since I had come to believe I was insane because I did so many
things I didn't want to do. I didn't want to neglect my children. I
loved them, I think, as much as any parent. But I did neglect them. I
didn't want to get into fights, but I did get into fights. I didn't want
to get arrested, but I did get arrested. I didn't want to jeopardize the
lives of innocent people by driving an automobile while intoxicated, but
I did. I quite naturally came to the conclusion that I must be insane.
My big job was to keep other people from finding it out. I can remember
well thinking that I would quit drinking, really go to work hard, apply
myself eight hours a day, five days a week, make a lot of money, and
then I could start drinking again. That was the reverse of my former
pattern of fearing to go to work because I might drink! Always at the
end of these dreams was drinking. Now I attempted to quit. I think this
was about 1927. I was divorced in 1925 or 1926. I determined that I
wouldn't drink. I remember one occasion when I did not drink for three
hundred and sixty-four days, but I didn't quite make the year.

Another time, I had gone around to Max R. trying to get a job driving
one of his trucks. He had known something of my drinking pattern, and he
asked me what I was doing about it. I told him that I had not had a
drink for ninety days and that I had come to the conclusion that I was
one of those individuals who couldn't drink. So, knowing that, I had
determined that so long as I lived I would never take another drink. On
that statement and the fact that I had been sober for ninety days, he
gave me a job selling lots in an allotment he had. I was moved in as
Sales Manager and had four men working under me. At the end of about
four months, I not only had good looking clothes---and I might say that
at the time I first talked to Max I didn't have a suit of clothes I
could bend over in real sudden; now I had six suits of clothes. I had an
automobile. Everything in the world a man could possibly want, and I was
driving from Akron to Cleveland, having just been to the bank and
discovered that I had approximately \$5,000. I drove towards Cleveland
wondering why I found myself in such a changed set of conditions as
compared with those of six months before. I came to the conclusion it
was because I hadn't been drunk. And I hadn't been drunk because I
hadn't taken a drink. And I then and there said a prayer, if you please.
An offer of appreciation for not having had a drink for those few months
and then and there, without anybody promising me anything or threatening
me, I made a solemn vow that never so long as I live would I take
another drink.

(My mother and father were Catholics and I had been baptized, but at the
end of my instructions for Confirmation I had not gone to church, and
then when my mother remarried, she married a Protestant and the whole
religious angle was forgotten. So I had never had any lasting contact
with any kind of religion.)

So I was driving to Cleveland when I made this solemn promise never to
drink again. That was at three-thirty in the afternoon. At three-thirty
the next morning, I was in Champlain Street Station, in jail for driving
while intoxicated and insulting an officer; and the suit of which I was
so proud was in such shape that the turnkey had to get me a pair of
trousers to go into court in the next morning. I had run into a man I
always drank with. Whenever this man and I met---I didn't know his name
then nor do I know it now---we would always get drunk. I had run into
him, and he looked real prosperous; his face and eyes looked clear and
he started to compliment me on my good front and how well I looked, and
I said, "I haven't had a drink for nine months." He said, "Well, I
haven't had a drink for three months." And we stood there for twenty
minutes, telling each other how much better we were, how much better we
looked, how much better off we were financially, mentally, physically,
morally, and in every way, shape and manner. And then we both realized
we should go. We shook hands, and he hung onto my hand for a moment and
said, "Tell you what I'll do for old times sake. I'll buy you one drink,
and if you suggest a second one, I'll poke you right in the nose." And I
think we calculated, or I did, that there wasn't anybody who knew that I
wasn't drinking. I could take one drink and get right back on the wagon.
Nobody would know it, so I agreed to have the one drink. We went into a
bootleg joint and I don't remember leaving the place. I was picked up at
two-thirty that morning with my car smashed up by a street-car because I
had run into a big concrete safety zone, and the street-car had run into
me, and they took me out through the roof---there's where I lost the
suit. I had lost a hundred dollors I had in my pocket, and lost a
wristwatch too. I lost the car, of course. But more important, I lost my
sobriety. And I continued to drink, on and off then, until every dollor
I had in the world was gone again and I was right back living at my
sister's, getting my cigaretts by calling her grocer and telling him to
put in a couple of cartons with her order, exactly as I had before I
started to work at Max's.

In 1932, some friends of mine advised me that I might try Christian
Science, which had done a lot for some of their friends. So I started to
investigate Science through some friends of mine who were Readers in the
church. I accepted their help, and it was helpful. I quit drinking
immediately. The circumstances under which I reached these people were
very odd because I was led there through things that I said when I
couldn't even remember speaking. I told somebody that I was going down
to get Christian Science and they took me down, but I don't remember
saying that. Yet I wound up at this place. I attended their meetings
every Sunday and Wednesday for about nine months. If there was a lecture
on the subject within a hundred miles of Akron, I attended. Then I
started to miss meetings because it was raining or snowing or something
else. Pretty soon, I wasn't going at all, and was avoiding those people
who had been so kind to me. I avoided them rather than explain why they
weren't seeing me. My sobriety continued for another six months.

At the end of fifteen months, I tried the beer experiment. After
drinking one glass of beer at the end of my work period for about five
days, I thought I'd better find out whether I really had the stuff
licked. So I didn't have a beer one night, and as I drove home I was
breaking my arm patting myself on the back because I had proved I could
lick liquor. I had proved that liquor was not my master. I had avoided a
drink this time. So having licked it, there was no reason why I
shouldn't have a drink, and I stopped in before I got home and had one.
Then I got into the habit of having beers, and decided that a drink of
whiskey was not any worse; so I would get the one drink of whiskey but,
on second thought, I decided that as long as I was only going to have
one, I might as well make it a double-header. So I had one double-header
every night for about two or three weeks. I didn't drink very long at a
time. I think the longest drunk I was ever on was eleven days, but
usually only two days with a complete blackout for a day, and then
backing off by drinking as long as I could get anything.

This Christian Science experience with a sobriety of fifteen months was
in 1932. Then I started drinking again, with possibly a little more
restraint, periods a little bit longer than they had been before, but
substantially the same pattern. During the latter part of the Christian
Science experience I had gotten a job and was working at Firestone. I
was bouncing along and not doing to badly. There were times when I got
to drinking, and I had been warned by Firestone that they wouldn't stand
for this much longer, so, clearly, they were conscious of the fact that
I drank too much and too often.

To show you the point to which this obsession went, there came an
occasion when I had spent a most delightful week-end, and at nine
o'clock on Sunday night I was on my way home, and I thought I would get
a drink. I went into a bar, and there I got into a fight. I was arrested
and taken to jail where I was beaten up by two or three fellows who were
already in there and whom I tried to boss. I was badly beaten. I tried
to conduct a kangeroo court and hit them with a broomstick. I had a
broken nose, a fractured cheekbone, and was black from the lower part of
my face up into my hair. I was black and blue, with my lips all swollen,
when they roused us to go into court in the morning. I looked so
terrible in the court that the judge suggested that I get a continuance
and let me sign all the papers to go to a hospital and to a doctor. I
went downstairs and there was the grizzly old veteran police officer in
charge of the property desk, and as he gave me the stuff, he asked, "Are
you going out in the street that way?" I said, "I'm certainly not going
to stay here!" I had white trousers on, white shoes and a white shirt
that was streaked with blood. He said, "Well, why don't you take a cab?"
I said, "Allright, call me a cab," as though I was talking to a bellboy.
He did call me a cab and when I got into the cab, I said, "Drive me to a
liquor store." We drove to a store in North Hill and I sent him in with
what money I had to get a quart. He brought the quart out and I took a
good swig. When I got home I had to give him a check for the taxi fare.
I drank some more and slept through the day. At night, I woke up and the
folks with whom I roomed were home by then. I offered them a drink, and
they came to the bottom of the stairs and I stuck my face around the top
of the stairs and the good woman fainted, just looking at me. So they
decided that I should have a doctor. They called a doctor and it
happened that they called one I knew. He came in and took a look at me
and sent me to the hospital.

When I had been in the hospital ten days, Sister Ignatia, who has played
such a part in the development of A.A. in this area, stuck her head in
the door one morning and announced, looking at me quizzically, that they
might be able to make something human out of my face after all. And at
the end of fourteen days, they let me out. Three days later I went to
work. The next day, they called me in for an examination, and the doctor
wouldn't let me continue working and pardoned me from the plant for ten
days because he said my eye had been injured. So I was barred from the
plant for ten days, and during that ten day period I was drunk twice,
showing how little control these restraints had on me.

Shortly after that, my brother, who had then become associated with a
group of people and had stopped drinking, urged me to attend meetings
with him. Naturally, I wanted no part of any meetings. I explained to my
sister that some of the people he was meeting with had been in
hospitals. I couldn't afford to be found with those people, but I said I
would certainly pay his dues if it would keep him from drinking. But me,
I wanted no part of it! I didn't have any need of such an association!

One morning, after I had been on a binge for a couple days, I awoke to
find my brother and Doctor Bob in my room talking to me about not
drinking. My only thought that day was getting a drink, and how to get
rid of those clowns was my big problem. They asked me if I would take
some medicine, and I promised that I would if they got me a drink. So
Paul was dispatched and brought back a pint. I got two drinks, each of
them a quarter of that pint, in me, and was talking along with these
people, but I felt that sooner or later they were going to have me
cornered because they were smarter than I was and the drink was
beginning to take effect; but as I reached for the third drink Bob said,
"Listen, Buster, you promised to take some medicine if we got you a
drink. Now we got you the drink, but you haven't taken the medicine." I
agreed with him and told him in no uncertain terms That I never broke my
word in my life. I told him I'd take the medicine and I would take it,
but I hadn't told him when, and thereupon I got away with the third
drink. I then began asking a lot of questions of both my brother and Dr.
Bob about how this worked, and I suppose I was becoming more glassy-eyed
all the while, for eventually I said to Bob, "Your all dried up. You're
never going to want another drink, are you?"; and this answer of his is
very important to those of us who are victims of alcoholism. He said,
"So long as I'm thinking as I'm thinking now, and so long as I'm doing
the things I'm doing now, I don't believe I'll ever take another drink."
And I said, "Well, what about Paul, have you got him all dried up?" He
said Paul would have to answer for himself. So Paul repeated
substantially what Dr. Bob had said. And I said, "Now you want to dry me
up. I'm not going to want another drink?" "Well," the doctor said, "we
have hopes in that direction." I said, "In that case, there's no use of
wasting this," and I got the last of that pint. A few minutes later, Dr.
Bob left, leaving with my brother some medicine I should get. Paul
measured the medicine out, but he figured that with my track record that
little bit wouldn't be enough, so he doubled it and added a few drops
more and then gave it to me. I immediately became unconscious. This was
on Thursday. I regained consciousness on Sunday. I had taken five and a
half ounces of paraldehyde. Because it effected so strenuously, they
felt that hospitalization was indicated and I awoke in a hospital.

On Sunday when I came to, it was a bad, wet, snowy day in February,
1937, and Paul and Doc and a lot of the other fellows were in Cleveland
on business. The people in the group hadn't been around that day; part
of my family was in Florida and the rest of them weren't speaking to me,
so I spent a very lonesome day and by evening I was feeling very sorry
for myself. It was getting pretty dark and I hadn't turned on any
lights, when some big fellow stepped inside the door and flipped on the
light switch. I said, "Look, Bub, if I want those lights on, I'll turn
them on." I'll never forget, he never even hesitated and I had never
seen him before in my life. He took off his hat and his overcoat, and he
said, "You don't look very good. How are you feeling?" I said, "How do
you suppose? I'm feeling terrible." He said, "Maybe you need a little
drink." That was the smartest man I'd met in months. I thought he had it
in his pocket, so I said, "You got some?" He said, "No, call the nurse."
And he got me a drink. Then he started to talk to me about his drinking
experiences, what his drinking had cost him, how much he had drunk and
where, things like that, and I remember I was quite bored because I had
never seen the guy before and had no interest at all in what, where and
when he drank. The man turned out to be Bill D., a very early member of
A.A., and I couldn't tell you a word of what he said. Not one experience
registered with me. When he left, I realized from his story that as a
drinker I was just a panty-waist. I knew I could quit because he had
quit; he hadn't had a drink for over a year. The important thing was
that he was happy. He was released, relieved from his alcoholism and was
happy and contented because of it. That I shall never forget.

The next day, others from the group came in to see me. I remember well
one fellow, Joe, walking nearly three miles through slush, wet and snow
to come to the hospital to see a man that he had never seen before in
his life, and that impressed me very much. He walked to the hospital to
save bus fare and did it gladly in order to be helpful to an individual
he had never even seen. There were only seven or eight people in the
group before me and they all visited me during my period in the
hospital. The very simple program they advised me to follow was that I
should ask to know God's will for me for that one day, and then, to the
best of my ability, to follow that, and at night to express my
gratefulness to God for the things that had happened to me during the
day. When I left the hospital I tried this for a day and it worked, for
a week and it worked, and for a month, and it worked---and then for a
year and it still worked. It has continued to work now for nearly
eighteen years.

### 1. The A.A. Traditions

To those now in its fold, Alcoholics Anonymous has made the difference
between misery and sobriety, and often the difference between life and
death. A.A. can, of course, mean just as much to uncounted alcoholics
not yet reached.

Therefore, no society of men and women ever had a more urgent NEED for
continuous effectiveness and permanent unity. We alcoholics see that we
must work together and hang together, else most of us will finally die
alone.

The \"12 Traditions\" of Alcoholics Anonymous are, we A.A.'s believe,
the best answers that our experience has yet given to those ever urgent
questions, \"How can A.A. best function?\" and, \"How can A.A. best stay
whole and so survive?\"

On the next page, A.A.'s \"12 Traditions\" are seen in their so-called
\"short form,\" the form in general use today. This is a condensed
version of the original \"long form\" A.A. Traditions as first printed
in 1946. Because the \"long form\" is more explicit and of possible
historic value, it is also reproduced.

One--Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends
upon A.A. unity.

Two--For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority--a loving
God as He may express Himself in our group conscience. Our leaders are
but trusted servants; they do not govern.

Three--The only requirement for A.A. membership is a desire to stop
drinking.

Four--Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other
groups, or A.A. as a whole.

Five--Each group has but one primary purpose--to carry its message to
the alcoholic who still suffers.

Six--An A.A. group ought never endorse, finance or lend the A.A. name to
any related facility or outside enterprise; lest problems of money,
property and prestige divert us from our primary purpose.

Seven--Every A.A. group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining
outside contributions.

Eight--Alcoholics Anonymous should remain forever nonprofessional, but
our service centers may employ special workers.

Nine--A.A., as such, ought never be organized; but we may create service
boards or committees directly responsible to those they serve.

Ten--Alcoholics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence the
A.A. name ought never be drawn into public controversy.

Eleven--Our public relations policy is based upon attraction rather than
promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of
press, radio and films.

Twelve--Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our Traditions,
ever reminding us to place principles before personalities.

Our A.A. experience has taught us that:

1.--Each member of Alcoholics Anonymous is but a small part of a great
whole. A.A. must continue to live or most of us will surely die. Hence
our common welfare comes first. But individual welfare follows close
afterward.

.--For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority--a loving
God as He may express Himself in our group conscience.

.--Our membership ought to include all who suffer from alcoholism. Hence
we may refuse none who wish to recover. Nor ought A.A. membership ever
depend upon money or conformity. Any two or three alcoholics gathered
together for sobriety may call themselves an A.A. Group, provided that,
as a group, they have no other affiliation.

.--With respect to its own affairs, each A.A. group should be
responsible to no other authority than its own conscience. But when its
plans concern the welfare of neighboring groups also, those groups ought
to be consulted. And no group, regional committee, or individual should
ever take any action that might greatly affect A.A. as a whole without
conferring with the Trustees of the General Service Board. On such
issues our common welfare is paramount.

.--Each Alcoholics Anonymous group ought to be a spiritual entity HAVING
BUT ONE PRIMARY PURPOSE--that of carrying its message to the alcoholic
who still suffers.

.--Problems of money, property, and authority may easily divert us from
our primary spiritual aim. We think, therefore, that any considerable
property of genuine use to A.A. should be separately incorporated and
managed, thus dividing the material from the spiritual. An A.A. group,
as such, should never go into business. Secondary aids to A.A., such as
clubs or hospitals which require much property or administration, ought
to be incorporated and so set apart that, if necessary, they can be
freely discarded by the groups. Hence such facilities ought not to use
the A.A. name. Their management should be the sole responsibility of
those people who financially support them. For clubs, A.A. managers are
usually preferred. But hospitals, as well as other places of
recuperation, ought to be well outside A.A.--and medically supervised.
While an A.A. group may cooperate with anyone, such cooperation ought
never go so far as affiliation or endorsement, actual or implied. An
A.A. group can bind itself to no one.

.--The A.A. group themselves ought to be fully supported by the
voluntary contributions of their own members. We think that each group
should soon achieve this ideal; that any public solicitation of funds
using the name of Alcoholics Anonymous is highly dangerous, whether by
groups, clubs, hospitals, or other outside agencies; that acceptance of
large gifts from any source, or of contributions carrying any obligation
whatever, is unwise. Then too, we view with much concern those A.A.
treasuries which continue, beyond prudent reserves, to accumulate funds
for no stated A.A. purpose. Experience has often warned us that nothing
can so surely destroy our spiritual heritage as futile disputes over
property, money, and authority.

.--Alcoholics Anonymous should remain forever nonprofessional. We define
professionalism as the occupation of counseling alcoholics for fees or
hire. But we may employ alcoholics where they are going to perform those
services for which we might otherwise have to engage nonalcoholics. Such
special services may be well recompensed. But our usual A.A. \"12th
Step\" work is never to be paid for.

.--Each A.A. groups needs the least possible organization. Rotating
leadership is the best. The small group may elect its Secretary, the
large group its Rotating Committee, and the groups of a large
Metropolitan area their Central or Intergroup Committee, which often
employs a full-time Secretary. The trustees of the General Service Board
are, in effect, our A.A. General Service Committee. They are the
custodians of our A.A. Tradition and the receivers of voluntary A.A.
contributions by which we maintain our A.A. General Service Office at
New York. They are authorized by the groups to handle our over-all
public relations and they guarantee the integrity of our principle
newspaper, \"The A.A. Grapevine.\" All such representatives are to be
guided in the spirit of service, for true leaders in A.A. are but
trusted and experienced servants of the whole. They derive no real
authority from their titles; they do not govern. Universal respect is
the key to their usefulness.

.--No A.A. group or member should ever, in such a way as to implicate
A.A., express any opinion on outside controversial issues--particularly
those of politics, alcohol reform, or sectarian religion. The Alcoholics
Anonymous groups oppose no one. Concerning such matters they can express
no views whatever.

.--Our relations with the general public should be characterized by
personal anonymity. We think A.A. ought to avoid sensational
advertising. Our names and pictures as A.A. members ought not be
broadcast, filmed, or publicly printed. Our public relations should be
guided by the principle of attraction rather than promotion. There is
never need to praise ourselves. We feel it better to let our friends
recommend us.

.--And finally, we of Alcoholics Anonymous believe that the principle of
Anonymity has an immense spiritual significance. It reminds us that we
are to place principles before personalities; that we are actually to
practice a genuine humility. This to the end that our great blessings
may never spoil us; that we shall forever live in thankful contemplation
of Him who presides over us all.

### 2. Spiritual Experience

The terms \"spiritual experience\" and \"spiritual awakening\" are used
many times in this book which, upon careful reading, shows that the
personality change sufficient to bring about recovery from alcoholism
has manifested itself among us in many different forms.

Yet it is true that our first printing gave many readers the impression
that these personality changes, or religious experiences, must be in the
nature of sudden and spectacular upheavals. Happily for everyone, this
conclusion is erroneous.

In the first few chapters a number of sudden revolutionary changes are
described. Though it was not our intention to create such an impression,
many alcoholics have nevertheless concluded that in order to recover
they must acquire an immediate and overwhelming \"God-consciousness\"
followed at once by a vast change in feeling and outlook.

Among our rapidly growing membership of thousands of alcoholics such
transformations, though frequent, are by no means the rule. Most of our
experiences are what the psychologist William James calls the
\"educational variety\" because they develop slowly over a period of
time. Quite often friends of the newcomer are aware of the difference
long before he is himself. He finally realizes that he has undergone a
profound alteration in his reaction to life; that such a change could
hardly have been brought about by himself alone. What often takes place
in a few months could hardly be accomplished by years of
self-discipline. With few exceptions our members find that they have
tapped an unsuspected inner resource which they presently identify with
their own conception of a Power greater than themselves.

Most of us think this awareness of a Power greater than ourselves is the
essence of spiritual experience. Our more religious members call it
\"God-consciousness.\"

Most emphatically we wish to say that any alcoholic capable of honestly
facing his problems in the light of our experience can recover, provided
he does not close his mind to all spiritual principles. He can only be
defeated by an attitude of intolerance or belligerent denial.

We find that no one need have difficulty with the spirituality of the
program. WILLINGNESS, HONESTY AND OPEN MINDEDNESS ARE THE ESSENTIALS OF
RECOVERY. BUT THESE ARE INDISPENSABLE.

### 3. The Medical View on A.A.

Since Dr. Silkworth's first endorsement of Alcoholics Anonymous, medical
societies and physicians throughout the world have set their approval
upon us. Following are excerpts from the comments of doctors present at
the actual meeting [^1] of the Medical Society of the State of New York
where a paper on A.A. was read:

Dr. Foster Kennedy, neurologist:

*\"This organization of Alcoholics Anonymous calls on two of the
greatest reservoirs of power known to man, religion and that instinct
for association with one's fellows\...the 'herd instinct.' I think our
profession must take appreciative cognizance of this great therapeutic
weapon. If we do not do so, we shall stand convicted of emotional
sterility and of having lost the faith that moves mountains, without
which medicine can do little.\"*

Dr. G. Kirby Collier, psychiatrist:

*\"I have felt that A.A. is a group unto themselves and their best
results can be had under their own guidance, as a result of their
philosophy. Any therapeutic or philosophic procedure which can prove a
recovery rate of 50% to 60% must merit our consideration.\"*

Dr. Harry M. Tiebout, psychiatrist:

*\"As a psychiatrist, I have thought a great deal about the relationship
of my speciality to A.A. and I have come to the conclusion that our
particular function can very often lie in preparing the way for the
patient to accept any sort of treatment or outside help. I now conceive
the psychiatrist's job to be the task of breaking down the patient's
inner resistance so that which is inside him will flower, as under the
activity of the A.A. program.\"*

Dr. W. W. Bauer, broadcasting under the auspices of The American Medical
Association in 1946, over the NBC network, said, in part:

*\"Alcoholics Anonymous are no crusaders; not a temperance society. They
know that they must never drink. They help others with similar
problems\... In this atmosphere the alcoholic often overcomes his
excessive concentration upon himself. Learning to depend upon a higher
power and absorb himself in his work with other alcoholics, he remains
sober day by day. The days add up into weeks, the weeks into months and
years.\"*

Dr. John F. Stouffer, Chief Psychiatrist, Philadelphia General Hospital,
citing his experience with A.A., said:

*\"The alcoholics we get here at Philadelphia General are mostly those
who cannot afford private treatment, and A.A. is by far the greatest
thing we have been able to offer them. Even among those who occasionally
land back in here again, we observe a profound change in personality.
You would hardly recognize them.\"*

The American Psychiatric Association requested, in 1949, that a paper he
prepared by one of the older members of Alcoholics Anonymous to be read
at the Association's annual meeting of that year. This was done, and the
paper was printed in the American Journal of Psychiatry for November,
1949.

(This address is now available in pamphlet form at nominal cost through
most A.A. groups or from Box 459, Grand Central Station, New York, NY
10163, under the title \"Three Talks to Medical Societies by Bill W.\"--
formerly called \"Bill on Alcoholism\" and earlier \"Alcoholism the
Illness.\")

### 4. The Lasker Award

In 1951 the Lasker Award was given Alcoholics Anonymous. The citation
reads in part as follows:

*\"The American Public Health Association presents a Lasker Group Award
1951 to Alcoholics Anonymous in recognition of its unique and highly
successful approach to that age-old public health and social problem,
alcoholism\... In emphasizing alcoholism as an illness, the social
stigma associated with this condition is being blotted out\...
Historians may one day recognize Alcoholics Anonymous to have been a
great venture in social pioneering which forged a new instrument for
social action; a new therapy based on the kinship of common suffering;
one having vast a potential for the myriad other ills of mankind.\"*

### 5. The Religious View on A.A.

Clergymen of practically every denomination have given A.A. their
blessing.

Edward Dowling, S.J., [^2] of the Queen's Work staff says, *\"Alcoholics
Anonymous is natural; it is natural at the point where nature comes
closest to the supernatural, namely in humiliations and in consequent
humility. There is something spiritual about an art museum or a
symphony, and the Catholic Church approves of our use of them. There is
something spiritual about A.A. too, and Catholic participation in it
almost invariably results in poor Catholics becoming better
Catholics.\"*

The Episcopal magazine, THE LIVING CHURCH, observes editorially: *\"The
basis of the technique of Alcoholics Anonymous is the truly Christian
principle that a man cannot help himself except by helping others. The
A.A. plan is described by the members themselves as 'self-insurance.'
This self-insurance has resulted in the restoration of physical, mental
and spiritual health and self-respect to hundreds of man and women who
would be hopelessly down and out without its unique but effective
therapy.\"*

Speaking at a dinner given by Mr. John D. Rockefeller to introduce
Alcoholics Anonymous to some of his friends, Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick
remarked:

*\"I think that psychologically speaking there is a point of advantage
in the approach that is being made in this movement that cannot be
duplicated. I suspect that if it is wisely handled--and it seems to be
in wise and prudent hands--there are doors of opportunity ahead of this
project that may surpass our capacities to imagine.\"*

### 6. How to Get in Touch With A.A.

In the United States and Canada, most towns and cities have A.A. groups.
In such places, A.A. can be located through the local telephone
directory, newspaper office, or police station, or by contacting local
priests or ministers. In large cities, groups often maintain local
offices where alcoholics or their families may arrange for interviews or
hospitalization. These so-called intergroup associations are found under
the listing \"A.A.\" or \"Alcoholics Anonymous\" in telephone
directories.

At New York, U.S.A., Alcoholics Anonymous maintains its international
service center. The General Service Board of A.A. (the trustees)
administers A.A.'s General Service Office, A.A. World Services, Inc.,
and our monthly magazine, the A.A. Grapevine.

If you cannot find A.A. in your locality, a letter addressed to
Alcoholics Anonymous, Box 459, Grand Central Station, New York, NY
10163, U.S.A., will receive a prompt reply from this world center,
referring you to the nearest A.A. group. If there is none nearby, you
will be invited to carry on a correspondence which will do much to
insure your sobriety no matter how isolated you are.

Should you be the relative or friend of an alcoholic who shows no
immediate interest in A.A., it is suggested that you write the Al-Anon
Family Groups, Inc., P. O. Box 862, Midtown Station, New York, NY 10018,
U.S.A.

This is a world clearing house for the Al-Anon Family Groups, composed
largely of the wives, husbands and friends of A.A. members. This
headquarters will give the location of the nearest Family Group and
will, if you wish, correspond with you about your special problems.

### 7. Twelve Concepts (Short Form)

A.A.'s Twelve Steps are principles for personal recovery. The Twelve
Traditions ensure the unity of the Fellowship. Written by co-founder
Bill W. in 1962, the Twelve Concepts for World Service provide a group
of related principles to help ensure that various elements of A.A.'s
service structure remain responsive and responsible to those they serve.
The "short form" of the Concepts, which follows, was approved by the
1971 General Service Conference.

I. Final responsibility and ultimate authority for A.A. world services
should always reside in the collective conscience of our whole
Fellowship.

II.The General Service Conference of A.A. has become, for nearly every
practical purpose, the active voice and the effective conscience of our
whole Society in its world affairs.

III\. To insure effective leadership, we should endow each element of
A.A.---the Conference, the General Service Board and its service
corporations, staffs, committees, and executives---with a traditional
"Right of Decision."

IV\. At all responsible levels, we ought to maintain a traditional
"Right of Participation," allowing a voting representation in reasonable
proportion to the responsibility that each must discharge.

V. Throughout our structure, a traditional "Right of Appeal" ought to
prevail, so that minority opinion will be heard and personal grievances
receive careful consideration.

VI\. The Conference recognizes that the chief initiative and active
responsibility in most world service matters should be exercised by the
trustee members of the Conference acting as the General Service Board.

VII\. The Charter and Bylaws of the General Service Board are legal
instruments, empowering the trustees to manage and conduct world service
affairs. The Conference Charter is not a legal document; it relies upon
tradition and the A.A. purse for final effectiveness.

VIII\. The trustees are the principal planners and administrators of
overall policy and finance. They have custodial oversight of the
separately incorporated and constantly active services, exercising this
through their ability to elect all the directors of these entities.

IX\. Good service leadership at all levels is indispensable for our
future functioning and safety. Primary world service leadership, once
exercised by the founders, must necessarily be assumed by the trustees.

X. Every service responsibility should be matched by an equal service
authority, with the scope of such authority well defined.

XI\. The trustees should always have the best possible committees,
corporate service directors, executives, staffs, and consultants.
Composition, qualifications, induction procedures, and rights and duties
will always be matters of serious concern.

XII\. The Conference shall observe the spirit of A.A. tradition, taking
care that it never becomes the seat of perilous wealth or power; that
sufficient operating funds and reserve be its prudent financial
principle; that it place none of its members in a position of
unqualified authority over others; that it reach all important decisions
by discussion, vote, and, whenever possible, by substantial unanimity;
that its actions never be personally punitive nor an incitement to
public controversy; that it never perform acts of government, and that,
like the Society it serves, it will always remain democratic in thought
and action.
