Preparation

All that's asked in preparation is to be there 7.30  
Those attending will be appreciative of the effort to make the drive and speak openly and casually about one's experience strength and hope  
There will likely be AA meeting literature available there  
There is a cupboard where a folder is usually stored on the top shelf which will contain the preamble and other pieces  
However it can be a good idea to bring ones own Big Book and preamble  
Some members bring biscuits and sugary products but tea and coffee will already be available there  
Contact can be made with the center in advance although this is not necessary  


Arrival

The entrance door will likely to be unlocked upon arrival and the councilor on duty will likely be there to assist with anything  
The top table and signs are usually setup in advance in the cafeteria area to the left  


Format

There is no set format beyond sharing our experience strength and hope.  
For specific ideas or structures, the Public Information Kit folder can be consulted.  
We have a PI kit at hand in the literature cupboard in Bundoran.  
One suggestion is to give a brief introduction and why you're here, followed by brief readings such as the following sequence  
Preamble  
Paragraph 1 and 2 of chapter 3  
Paragraph 1 and 2 of chapter 5  
These readings are brief and captures the important aspects for potential newcomers  
Those attending are at the end of an intensive day of rehabilitation work and can be more receptive to shorter shares and a more interactive Q&A style meeting  
The lead often gives an opening share of 5 to 10 minutes and subsequently offers the other 1 or 2 speakers wto share for 5 minutes  
It's optional to open the floor to questions and discussion throughout the top table shares  


Closing

After the meeting concludes the guys are often interested to have tea in the common room and continue chatting

## Phone Service

Service Structure: Phone Service

Donegal Area takes every 8th week in rotation  
A member can put themselves forward for a single day in that week  
Monday to Thursday 9am to 5pm  
Friday to Sunday 9am to 9pm  
There can be anything from one to a dozen plus calls in a single day  
Each call can take perhaps 5 to 15 minutes to fully resolve  

How It Works

A phone app is used to redirect calls to your personal phone for the specified time  
The job of phone service is to connect the caller to a 12TH stepper from the index who is within close proximity to them  
Training will be provided if necessary
