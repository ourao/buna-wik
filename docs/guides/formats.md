Format Proposals  

Many ideas have recently been put forth within group conscience to work on unity. These mostly take the form of structural approaches within a meeting to disagreement or actions which can cause significant offense. These are yet to be fully worked out and formalised via group conscience and are listed here for reference and reflection.  

These include but are not exhaustive to  
1 hour meeting time.  
5 minutes per share.  
A notification plague for time.  
No fowl/vulgar language.  
Speaker meeting versus open floor depending on attendance and chair.  
Keeping the door closed with the sign on the outside.  

Suggested statement on the use of foul language  
We ask you to refrain from cursing. It can cause offence but its absence rarely does.

## Preamble

Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of people who share their experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism.

The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. There are no dues or fees for A.A. membership; we are self-supporting through our own contributions. A.A. is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy; neither endorses nor opposes any causes. Our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.


## Singleness Of Purpose

CLOSED MEETING

This is a closed meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous. In support of A.A.’s singleness of purpose, attendance at closed meetings is limited to persons who have a desire to stop drinking. If you think you have a problem with alcohol, you are welcome to attend this meeting. We ask that when discussing our problems, we confine ourselves to those problems as they relate to alcoholism.

OPEN MEETING

This is an open meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous. We are glad you are all here — especially newcomers. In keeping with our singleness of purpose and our Third Tradition which states that “The only requirement for A.A. membership is a desire to stop drinking,” we ask that all who participate confine their discussion to their problems with alcohol.


## Chapter 5 How It Works

> BB p58

Rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path. Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program, usually men and women who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves. There are such unfortunates. They are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way. They are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner of living which demands rigorous honesty. Their chances are less than average. There are those, too, who suffer from grave emotional and mental disorders, but many of them do recover if they have the capacity to be honest.

Our stories disclose in a general way what we used to be like, what happened, and what we are like now. If you have decided you want what we have and are willing to go to any length to get it—then you are ready to take certain steps.

At some of these we balked. We thought we could ﬁnd an easier, softer way. But we could not. With all the earnestness at our command, we beg of you to be fearless and thorough from the very start. Some of us have tried to hold on to our old ideas and the result was nil until we let go absolutely.

Remember that we deal with alcohol—cunning, baf­ﬂing, powerful! Without help it is too much for us. But there is One who has all power—that One is God. May you ﬁnd Him now!

Half measures availed us nothing. We stood at the turning point. We asked His protection and care with complete abandon.

Here are the steps we took, which are suggested as a program of recovery:

1. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.
2. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol— that our lives had become unmanageable.
3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.
4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.
5. Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.
6. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.
7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.
8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.
9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.
10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.
11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.
12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.

Many of us exclaimed, “What an order! I can’t go through with it.’’ Do not be discouraged. No one among us has been able to maintain anything like perfect adherence to these principles. We are not saints. The point is, that we are willing to grow along spiritual lines. The principles we have set down are guides to progress. We claim spiritual progress rather than spiritual perfection.

Our description of the alcoholic, the chapter to the agnostic, and our personal adventures before and after make clear three pertinent ideas:

(a) That we were alcoholic and could not manage our own lives.
(b) That probably no human power could have relieved our alcoholism.
(c) That God could and would if He were sought.


## The AA Promises (Step 9 Promises)

> BB p83-84

We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness.  
We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it.  
We will comprehend the word serenity and we will know peace.  
No matter how far down the scale we have gone, we will see how our experience can benefit others.  
That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear.  
We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in our fellows.  
Self seeking will slip away.  
Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change.  
Fear or people and of economic insecurity will leave us.  
We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us.  
We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.  

Are these extravagant promises?  
We think not.  
They are being fulfilled among us—sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly.  
They will always materialize if we work for them.
